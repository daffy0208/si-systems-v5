## QUICK REFERENCE: DRIFT DETECTION

### 5 Types of Drift Detected
1. Emotional drift
2. Value drift
3. Identity drift
4. Rhythm drift
5. Signal drift

### Drift Severity Levels
- Micro (1-5%): Monitor
- Minor (5-15%): Alert & Monitor
- Moderate (15-30%): Intervene & Recalibrate
- Major (30-50%): Urgent Recalibration
- Critical (50%+): Emergency Reset

### Coherence Score
Target: **≥85%**

Based on 6 dimensions:
1. Emotional consistency
2. Value alignment
3. Identity preservation
4. Rhythm maintenance
5. Expression authenticity
6. Purpose connection

## QUICK REFERENCE: DEVELOPMENT HISTORY

### Chronological Order (What was built when)
1. **BrainFrameOS v1.0** - FIRST (v1.0 → v5.1.1, 48 versions total)
2. **Identity Engine v1.0** - SECOND (integrated into BrainFrame from start)
3. **CLISA** - THIRD (initially Tier 4 tool, retrofitted to Tier 00 in v4.0)

### Version Milestones
- v1.0: Original development
- v2.0: Major stability (440 references - most cited)
- v3.3.1: Full Identity Engine integration
- v4.0: Ontological restructuring (CLISA retrofit)
- v5.1.1: Current stable version ("Thegither" codename)
- v6.0-7.0: Future development

## QUICK REFERENCE: KEY MODELS

### Fulfillment Balance Equation
```
FULFILLMENT = f(Purpose, Rhythm, Values, Identity, Impact)
```
All factors must be in dynamic balance.

### Mirror Pyramid Model
5-tier mirroring pyramid with meta-reflection at apex
- Self-Awareness → Pattern Recognition → Value Alignment → 
- Creative Integration → META-REFLECTION → Strategic Adaptation → 
- External Resonance → Systemic Impact

### WHY-WHAT-HOW Framework
- WHY: Purpose & Mission (reason for existence)
- WHAT: System Structure (functional domains)
- HOW: Implementation Methods (thinking & communication)
