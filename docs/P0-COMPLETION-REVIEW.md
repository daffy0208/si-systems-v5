## 🎯 Task Breakdown

### P0-1: Enhance NLP Analysis
**Status:** 🟡 REVIEW (Infrastructure Complete, Calibration Pending)
**Duration:** ~4 hours (estimated: 5-6 days)
**Priority:** 107 (highest)

#### ✅ What's Complete

**Infrastructure (100%):**
- ✅ NLP Pipeline with sentiment analysis (`sentiment` library)
- ✅ Embedding generation (Transformers.js, all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
- ✅ Semantic similarity computation (cosine similarity)
- ✅ LRU caching (sentiment: 1000, embeddings: 500)
- ✅ Enhanced drift detector with opt-in NLP
- ✅ Graceful fallback to heuristics
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained (all 7 original tests pass)

**Performance (Exceeds Targets):**
- ✅ Baseline detector: **0.01ms** avg (target: 150ms) - 14,900x faster
- ✅ Enhanced with NLP: **0.03ms** avg (target: 150ms) - 5,000x faster
- ✅ Full workflow: **96,846 ops/sec** throughput
- ✅ Memory: Well under 100MB target

**Testing:**
- ✅ 25+ NLP-specific tests created
- ✅ Integration tests for NLP features
- ✅ Evaluation framework created (21 test cases)
- ✅ Diagnostic tools for debugging detection

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ TypeScript with full type safety
- ✅ Zod schema validation
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

#### 🟡 What Needs Work (Review)

**Calibration (~2-4 hours estimated):**
- Current accuracy: 52.4% (same as baseline)
- Sentiment library limitations identified (balances pos/neg words)
- Token-based detection implemented but needs tuning
- Threshold optimization required

**Options for Completion:**
1. **Quick Fix (2 hours):** Tune existing thresholds and scoring
2. **Library Swap (4 hours):** Replace `sentiment` with `natural` or `compromise`
3. **Hybrid Approach (3 hours):** Combine heuristics + NLP with weighted scoring

**Recommendation:** Option 3 (Hybrid Approach) for best accuracy/performance balance
