## Executive Summary

Dark Matter Mode is BrainFrameOS's shadow pattern detection and conversion system. It analyzes unconscious patterns, blind spots, and distortion signals to transform "shadow" (unconscious material) into "signal" (conscious awareness).

**Purpose**: Convert hidden, unconscious patterns into recognized, integrated signals for identity coherence.

**Integration**: Operates as subsystem within BrainFrameOS cognitive architecture (Tier 27).

## Field Dynamics (5 Layers)

Dark Matter Mode operates across five depth layers of the cognitive field:

### Layer 1: Surface Signals
- **Depth**: Conscious awareness
- **Content**: Readily visible patterns
- **Detection**: Immediate, obvious
- **Examples**: Explicitly stated values, conscious behaviors

### Layer 2: Near-Shadow
- **Depth**: Semiconscious patterns
- **Content**: Just below awareness threshold
- **Detection**: Recognizable with minimal prompting
- **Examples**: Habits you know but don't think about, familiar biases

### Layer 3: Mid-Shadow
- **Depth**: Subconscious patterns
- **Content**: Requires active exploration to detect
- **Detection**: Emerges through reflection or external feedback
- **Examples**: Recurring relationship patterns, hidden assumptions

### Layer 4: Deep-Shadow
- **Depth**: Unconscious patterns
- **Content**: Strongly defended, resistant to awareness
- **Detection**: Requires sustained shadow work or external intervention
- **Examples**: Core wounds, fundamental defense mechanisms

### Layer 5: Core-Shadow
- **Depth**: Fundamental identity patterns
- **Content**: Bedrock unconscious material
- **Detection**: Rare, requires deep therapeutic or transformative work
- **Examples**: Existential fears, primary attachment patterns, identity-level defenses

## Detection Algorithms (5 Core)

### Algorithm 1: Pattern Discontinuity Detection
**Purpose**: Identify breaks in signal coherence

**Method**:
- Statistical variance analysis across conversation history
- Detect sudden shifts in tone, values, or rhythm
- Flag inconsistencies between stated identity and behavior

**Triggers**: Variance > threshold across multiple dimensions

### Algorithm 2: Mirror Distortion Analysis
**Purpose**: Detect misalignment between self-image and external signals

**Method**:
- Compare Identity Profile against actual conversation patterns
- Measure gap between stated values and expressed behavior
- Identify projection patterns

**Triggers**: Identity-behavior mismatch > threshold

### Algorithm 3: Rhythm Disruption Mapping
**Purpose**: Find temporal pattern breaks indicating shadow activation

**Method**:
- Analyze conversational rhythm for anomalies
- Detect energy drops, resistance patterns
- Identify avoidance behaviors

**Triggers**: Rhythm coherence score drops significantly

### Algorithm 4: Blind Spot Triangulation
**Purpose**: Identify consistently avoided topics or patterns

**Method**:
- Track topic avoidance across multiple conversations
- Map "white spaces" in conversational content
- Cross-reference with Identity Profile for expected vs actual coverage

**Triggers**: Consistent topic avoidance + identity relevance

### Algorithm 5: Projection Pattern Recognition
**Purpose**: Detect externalization of internal shadow material

**Method**:
- Analyze attribution patterns in conversation content
- Identify excessive external attribution
- Compare self-other language patterns

**Triggers**: High external attribution + low self-attribution patterns
