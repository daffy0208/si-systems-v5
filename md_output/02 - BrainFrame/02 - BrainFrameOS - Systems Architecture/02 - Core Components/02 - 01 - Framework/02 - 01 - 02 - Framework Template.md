**02 - 01 - 02 - Framework Template**

**Purpose of This Template**

This template helps you define your own Framework --- the foundation of
your personal system. It captures your **Why**, **What**, and **How** so
that everything else you do can align to it.

Use it as a living document. It can evolve, but it starts by anchoring
your system in clarity.

**üß≠ WHY --- Purpose & Values**

- **My deeper mission:** (e.g. "To unlock progress that matters to
  people and the world.")

- **Core values that guide me:** 1. 2. 3.

- **What matters most to me:** (e.g. Contribution, growth, autonomy,
  creativity, connection\...)

**üõ†Ô∏è WHAT --- Roles & Strengths**

- **Key roles I play in life/work:** 1. 2. 3.

- **My strongest abilities / traits:** (e.g. Systems thinking, empathy,
  strategy, teaching, storytelling\...)

- **What I am here to build or become:** (e.g. A trusted guide, a
  builder of solutions, a clear thinker\...)

**‚öôÔ∏è HOW --- Cognitive & Behavioural Style**

- **How I think:** (e.g. Fast-moving, visual, pattern-oriented, curious,
  associative\...)

- **How I work best:** (e.g. In sprints, with freedom, using visuals,
  with external feedback\...)

- **My growth and reflection rhythms:** (e.g. Weekly reviews, idea
  mapping, deep conversations, journaling\...)

**Final Notes**

- There are no wrong answers --- this is your Framework.

- Be honest and clear. The more real this is, the more powerful the
  system becomes.

- You can revisit and refine this over time.

**Next:** Move on to the SelfFrame Template in \[02 - 02 - 01 -
SelfFrame Template.docx\] to build a more detailed version of your
Framework that integrates with the BrainFrame system.
