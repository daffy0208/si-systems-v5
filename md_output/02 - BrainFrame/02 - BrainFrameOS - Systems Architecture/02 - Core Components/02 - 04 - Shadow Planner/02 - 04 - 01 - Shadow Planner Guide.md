**02 - 04 - 01 - Shadow Planner Guide**

**Purpose of This Guide**

The Shadow Planner is your weekly rhythm tool inside BrainFrameOS. It
connects your Framework to real-world action, clarity, and reflection.

This guide shows you how to use it --- and more importantly, how to
adapt it to your natural working style.

**What Is the Shadow Planner?**

A lightweight weekly structure built to:

- Anchor your week in purpose (Why)

- Keep your focus aligned with your outcomes (What)

- Reflect your unique style of working (How)

It isn't about scheduling. It's about **rhythm, momentum, and
feedback**.

**Core Elements**

1.  **Start of Week Setup**

    - Clarify focus, energy, and direction.

    - Use your SelfFrame as reference.

2.  **Midweek Check-In**

    - Quick scan for drift, distractions, or clarity boosts.

3.  **End-of-Week Reflection**

    - Look back with honesty.

    - Extract insights, alignment, and course-corrections.

4.  **Shadow Notes**

    - Micro-journaling space for tracking thoughts, wins, tensions,
      patterns.

**Weekly Rhythm**

- **Monday:** Complete "Start of Week" prompts

- **Wednesday:** Quick Midweek Check-In

- **Friday:** End-of-Week Reflection + Shadow Notes

Each session takes 5--15 minutes. The key is **consistency** --- not
perfection.

**Using Your Planner**

- Use \[02 - 04 - 02 - Prompts Sheet.docx\] for ready-made questions

- Use \[02 - 04 - 03 - Printable Planner Pages.docx\] to create a
  physical or digital notebook

You can also create your own prompt set --- the planner is flexible by
design.

**Final Notes**

- The Shadow Planner isn't for task management --- it's for **alignment
  and insight**.

- Done weekly, it prevents drift and sharpens your thinking.

- It's your mirror, not your manager.
