**03-02 Analogue Neuralink Explanation**

BrainFrame operates as an analogue to a neuralink --- not in a
technological sense, but in a functional and cognitive one.

Where a neuralink aims to connect brain and machine through physical
interface, **BrainFrame connects your mind and tools through cognitive
interface**.

It does this by:

- Translating abstract thought into structured expression.

- Acting as an extension of working memory.

- Mirroring how associative, layered thinking actually unfolds.

- Supporting recursive reflection and idea development.

**Why Analogue?**

- Unlike digital implants or direct-control devices, BrainFrame respects
  the **organic nature of human thought**.

- It sits beside your cognition --- not inside it.

- It supports thought without replacing it.

- It reveals inner architecture without collapsing nuance.

**Functional Equivalence**

- **Working Memory Buffer** → Shadow Planner

- **Semantic Network Activation** → Prompt Library + Linkage Maps

- **Pattern Recognition Loop** → Feedback Cycles + Reflection Engine

- **Concept Compression / Recall** → SelfFrame Modules

- **Recursive Self-Referencing** → Timeline Reviews + Meta Prompts

**Human-First Integration**

- Designed for flexibility, ambiguity, and emotion --- not just logic.

- Works in metaphor, sketch, prose, or structured outputs.

- Adapts to your rhythm and reflection style.

- Connects internal perception with external action.

BrainFrame doesn't aim to become your brain. It helps you *see* it ---
and from there, shape it with greater agency.

It is your analogue neuralink --- made of insight, reflection, and
intention.
