**07-03 Alt SelfFrame Test Folder**

This folder contains alternate versions and experimental branches of the
SelfFrame module.

These are used for:

- Testing new psychological models

- Adapting to different user types (e.g. teams, neurodivergent users)

- Exploring new visual layouts or framing approaches

**Current Variants**

**1. Value Vector SelfFrame**

- Models user across three core value tensions (e.g. Stability vs
  Growth, Contribution vs Expression)

- Output: Compass diagram with weighted tensions

**2. Seasonal SelfFrame**

- Captures user energy, motivation, and focus as seasonal metaphors
  (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter)

- Allows dynamic shift tracking month-to-month

**3. Shadow-Centric SelfFrame**

- Focuses on unresolved tensions, fear loops, and hidden beliefs

- Used only with opt-in --- designed for deep internal work

**Guidelines for Use**

- These versions are experimental and may evolve rapidly

- Can be used in parallel with main SelfFrame or standalone

- Feedback encouraged via Sandbox Log

**Future Ideas (Unbuilt)**

- Narrative Archetype SelfFrame

- Feedback-Driven Adaptive SelfFrame

- Role-Based Collaborative SelfFrames

These variants exist not to replace the SelfFrame --- but to expand its
possibilities.

**Try. Reflect. Evolve.**
