**08-02 How to Build Your SelfFrame**

The SelfFrame is your personal operating system --- a living snapshot of
who you are, how you think, what drives you, and what holds you back.

It's not a personality test. It's a reflective tool designed to:

- Increase self-awareness

- Align decision-making

- Track how you evolve over time

**Step 1: Name Your Current Roles**

Who are you showing up as? Parent, builder, leader, learner?

**Step 2: Identify Core Drivers**

What motivates you? Try:

- Contribution

- Freedom

- Progress

- Belonging

- Mastery

Pick 2--4 that resonate. Add your own if needed.

**Step 3: Map Current Tensions**

What's pulling you in opposite directions?

- Stability vs Change

- Speed vs Depth

- Focus vs Freedom

Tensions are not problems. They're signals.

**Step 4: Note Cognitive & Emotional Style**

How do you process the world?

- Visual / Verbal / Spatial / Narrative

- Fast-switcher / Deep-diver / Parallel-thinker

- Empathic / Analytical / Cyclical

**Step 5: Define Energy Zones**

When do you feel most alive? What drains you?

Use a simple quadrant:

- High Energy + High Meaning

- High Energy + Low Meaning

- Low Energy + High Meaning

- Low Energy + Low Meaning

**Step 6: Choose Your Growth Theme**

What's the arc right now?

- Becoming more \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

- Letting go of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

- Learning to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ ?

Once complete, your SelfFrame becomes a reflection anchor --- visible to
you, usable by the AI, and evolving with your journey.

**Know your frame. Shape your path.**
