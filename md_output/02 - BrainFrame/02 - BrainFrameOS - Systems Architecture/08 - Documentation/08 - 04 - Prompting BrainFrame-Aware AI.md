**08-04 Prompting BrainFrame-Aware AI**

BrainFrame-aware AI is designed to interact with context, intention, and
self-awareness --- but the magic comes alive when you know how to prompt
it.

This guide helps you ask better questions, give smarter inputs, and
co-think more fluidly.

**Foundational Prompting Tips**

1.  **Set the Frame**

\"Use my SelfFrame to guide this answer...\"

2.  **Specify the Tone or Role**

\"Speak as a curious partner, not a coach.\"

3.  **Use Time Anchors**

\"Zoom out to a 3-month lens...\"\
\"Compare this with what I said last week.\"

4.  **Surface Tensions**

\"What's the conflict between my desire for freedom and my need for
structure here?\"

5.  **Meta-Prompts (Reflect on the Reflection)**

\"What am I not seeing clearly in my own reasoning?\"

**Prompt Starters by Type**

- **Decision Support:**

  - \"What frame might help me see this more clearly?\"

  - \"Play devil's advocate on this plan.\"

- **Clarity Expansion:**

  - \"Help me map the real question behind this surface confusion.\"

- **Momentum Activation:**

  - \"Turn this vague impulse into a concrete next move.\"

- **Emotional Processing:**

  - \"What might this discomfort be protecting me from?\"

**Best Practice: Stack Prompts**

Use 2--3 in sequence:

1.  Ask for perspective

2.  Reflect on the answer

3.  Ask for a new way to frame it

**Prompting isn't an input. It's a dialogue.**

Use it to think with, not just get answers from.
