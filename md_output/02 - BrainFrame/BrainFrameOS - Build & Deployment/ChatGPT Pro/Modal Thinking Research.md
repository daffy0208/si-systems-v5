looking for systems that: - Provide clearly defined \*\*modes\*\* or
\*\*thinking states\*\* - Adapt the user interface, behaviour,
suggestions, workflows, or AI output based on the selected mode - Enable
mental separation between cognitive actions (e.g., capture, reflect,
analyse, decide, focus, create) - May include \*\*AI tools\*\*,

I forgot to press the Deep Research button.

**ChatGPT said:**

No problem! Before I start the deep research, could you please confirm a
few quick things:

1.  Are you targeting specific industries (e.g., education, healthcare,
    UX design) or should this be broad?

2.  Should I focus on tools currently in use or also include emerging or
    academic concepts?

3.  Do you prefer a downloadable format (e.g. Excel/CSV) for the
    comparison matrix?

Once I have this, I'll kick off the research right away.

**You said:**

No specific industries, and include all tools currently in use and any
emerging or academic concepts. I don\'t want you to do a comparison
matrix. That was for me for a follow up.

**ChatGPT said:**

Perfect. I'll begin a deep investigation into tools, platforms, systems,
and conceptual frameworks that support modal thinking---structured
transitions between distinct cognitive modes. This will include AI
tools, coaching methods, productivity frameworks, and learning
environments, with a strong focus on real-world use, UX behavior, and
user benefits.

I'll return with a structured list of at least 15 high-quality entries,
complete with design logic, psychological foundations, and relevant user
reviews or use cases.

Modal Thinking and Contextual Cognitive Interfaces

**Modal Thinking Tools and Frameworks**

Below is a curated list of **15+ tools, platforms, and frameworks that
exemplify "modal thinking."** Each entry describes how distinct modes
are defined and used, how the interface or process changes with mode
switching, the benefits for users, typical use cases, and unique
aspects. *("Modal thinking" here means structuring work or thought into
separate **modes** -- e.g. capturing ideas vs. reflecting on them --
rather than doing everything in one undifferentiated workflow. This
approach helps reduce confusion from multitasking by focusing on one
cognitive mode at a
time[safetyculture.com](https://safetyculture.com/topics/six-thinking-hats/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20Dr,of%20responsibilities%20to%20overwhelm%20them)[safetyculture.com](https://safetyculture.com/topics/six-thinking-hats/#:~:text=Quality%20decision).)*

**1. Six Thinking Hats (Edward de Bono's Modes of Thinking)**

- **What it is:** A **group brainstorming and problem-solving
  framework** where participants sequentially adopt six different
  "hats," each representing a distinct thinking mode (facts, emotions,
  caution, optimism, creativity, and process
  control)[safetyculture.com](https://safetyculture.com/topics/six-thinking-hats/#:~:text=book%20called%20%E2%80%9CSix%20Thinking%20Hats%E2%80%9D,%E2%80%9D)[safetyculture.com](https://safetyculture.com/topics/six-thinking-hats/#:~:text=Quality%20decision).
  This ensures everyone examines an issue from one perspective at a
  time.

- **Modal structure:** **Six predefined modes**, symbolized by colored
  hats. The sequence can be set by a facilitator. **Each mode has
  rules**: e.g. **White Hat = objective facts**, **Red Hat = feelings**,
  **Black Hat = critical judgment**, etc. Participants consciously
  "switch hats" together, focusing only on that mode.

- **Interface/experience:** Often done in workshops or meetings;
  sometimes a **moderator will use physical colored hats or cards** to
  signal the current mode. In digital use, teams might use a
  collaboration tool or template (e.g. a Miro board or ClickUp template)
  partitioned into six sections for each hat. Everyone changes their
  input style according to the active hat (e.g. only list facts during
  White
  Hat)[safetyculture.com](https://safetyculture.com/topics/six-thinking-hats/#:~:text=Quality%20decision).

- **User benefits:** Encourages **cognitive separation of tasks**,
  preventing the confusion of trying to be creative and critical
  simultaneously. By **focusing on one thinking style at a time**, teams
  reduce conflict and **consider every angle** in an organized
  way[safetyculture.com](https://safetyculture.com/topics/six-thinking-hats/#:~:text=Using%20the%20six%20thinking%20hats,making)[safetyculture.com](https://safetyculture.com/topics/six-thinking-hats/#:~:text=Quality%20decision).
  This leads to more thorough analysis and **better-quality decisions**.

- **Use cases:** Widely used in **business strategy, design ideation,
  and education** for group discussions. Targeted at teams that need
  structured creativity and decision-making. For example, a product
  design team might do a round of **Green Hat (creative ideas)**
  thinking, then put on the **Black Hat (critical)** to evaluate those
  ideas.

- **UX feedback:** Considered a **powerful tool for inclusive, organized
  collaboration**, as it gives quieter members a chance to contribute in
  e.g. Green (creative) or Yellow (optimistic) modes who might otherwise
  be drowned out by criticism. Many find it **reduces meeting
  chaos**[safetyculture.com](https://safetyculture.com/topics/six-thinking-hats/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20Dr,of%20responsibilities%20to%20overwhelm%20them).
  It's taught in management training with positive results, though it
  requires facilitator skill to enforce mode discipline.

- **Mode switching support:** The framework **itself is the support** --
  typically one person directs "Now let's all switch to Red Hat." Some
  software (like brainstorming apps or electronic meeting systems) may
  have Six Hats templates, but mode enforcement is usually manual.

- **Comparison:** Unlike free-form meetings, Six Hats imposes
  **sequential modality**, which proponents say yields more creativity
  and less personal attack (since critical mode is separate and
  impersonal)[safetyculture.com](https://safetyculture.com/topics/six-thinking-hats/#:~:text=situations%20and%20problems%20from%20various,the%20habitual%20ways%20of%20thinking)[safetyculture.com](https://safetyculture.com/topics/six-thinking-hats/#:~:text=match%20at%20L58%20Furthermore%2C%20Dr,of%20responsibilities%20to%20overwhelm%20them).
  Compared to conventional brainstorming, it explicitly cycles through
  emotional and evaluative phases that might otherwise be ignored.

- **Unique aspects:** Six Hats is philosophically grounded in de Bono's
  idea that **confusion arises from attempting multiple thinking modes
  at
  once**[safetyculture.com](https://safetyculture.com/topics/six-thinking-hats/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20Dr,of%20responsibilities%20to%20overwhelm%20them).
  It externalizes mental modes (via hat colors) in a tangible way,
  making an abstract cognitive process a shared, game-like activity.

- **Supporting theory:** Aligns with psychology research on **attention
  and task-switching** -- by batching similar thought processes,
  cognitive load is reduced. Also touches on the idea of **role-play**
  in group dynamics (everyone is "wearing a hat" which sanctions a
  certain behavior).

**2. Bullet Journal Method (Capture & Reflect Modes)**

- **What it is:** An **analog journaling system** (created by Ryder
  Carroll) that structures personal planning and reflection into
  distinct phases. Users rapidly **log daily entries** (tasks, events,
  notes) in a minimalist format, then regularly **review and migrate**
  these items during dedicated reflection
  sessions[eljardindegestalt.com](https://eljardindegestalt.com/en/posts/holistic-reflection-bullet-journal/#:~:text=On%20Friday%2029%20March%20I,did%20my%20first%20%C2%ABmonthly%20migration%C2%BB)[eljardindegestalt.com](https://eljardindegestalt.com/en/posts/holistic-reflection-bullet-journal/#:~:text=all%20the%20pages%20of%20the,you%20an%20accurate%20overview%20of).

- **Modal structure:** Two main "modes" are **rapid logging (daily
  capture)** vs. **reflection/migration (periodic review)**. Daily mode
  is quick and ongoing -- jotting tasks with symbols. **Monthly and
  future logs** provide higher-level planning. At the end of day or
  month, the user enters a **reflection mode**: reviewing what was
  written, crossing out irrelevant items, and migrating forward
  important unfinished
  tasks[tinyrayofsunshine.com](https://www.tinyrayofsunshine.com/blog/migration#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)[eljardindegestalt.com](https://eljardindegestalt.com/en/posts/holistic-reflection-bullet-journal/#:~:text=The%20monthly%20migration%20consists%20of,don%E2%80%99t%20leave%20any%20loose%20ends).
  This separation ensures capture and reflection are distinct
  activities.

- **Interface/experience:** It's typically done with a pen and notebook
  divided into sections (Index, Future Log, Monthly Log, Daily Log). In
  "capture mode," the user writes bullets and signifiers as things
  occur. In "reflection mode," often at month's end, they physically
  flip through pages and mark items (e.g. \> to migrate, x to
  cancel)[tinyrayofsunshine.com](https://www.tinyrayofsunshine.com/blog/migration#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D)[eljardindegestalt.com](https://eljardindegestalt.com/en/posts/holistic-reflection-bullet-journal/#:~:text=The%20monthly%20migration%20consists%20of,don%E2%80%99t%20leave%20any%20loose%20ends).
  Some digital BuJo apps now mimic this by prompting review sessions.

- **User benefits:** **Forces regular reflection and prioritization.**
  The act of rewriting or migrating tasks makes you "re-commit" to them
  -- if a task isn't worth the effort to rewrite, it's probably not
  important[tinyrayofsunshine.com](https://www.tinyrayofsunshine.com/blog/migration#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D).
  This weeds out distractions and promotes focus on meaningful tasks.
  Users report greater mindfulness and alignment of daily actions with
  long-term
  goals[eljardindegestalt.com](https://eljardindegestalt.com/en/posts/holistic-reflection-bullet-journal/#:~:text=all%20the%20pages%20of%20the,you%20an%20accurate%20overview%20of)[tinyrayofsunshine.com](https://www.tinyrayofsunshine.com/blog/migration#:~:text=Oftentimes%20we%20can%20go%20on,one%20point%20wanted%20to%20do).

- **Use cases:** Popular with **productivity enthusiasts, students, and
  professionals** who prefer tactile planning. It's personal (solo use).
  **Goal setting, habit tracking, and gratitude journaling** are often
  integrated. The structured daily+monthly reviews help anyone who wants
  a balance of doing vs. reflecting -- e.g. a freelancer tracking tasks
  and periodically reviewing progress.

- **UX feedback:** The Bullet Journal has a large community because of
  its flexibility and effectiveness. Users love the "rapid logging" for
  capturing everything (less mental clutter) and credit the reflection
  phase for improving intentionality. It's described as a **"holistic
  reflection on your life"** that connects day-to-day actions with
  bigger-picture
  thinking[eljardindegestalt.com](https://eljardindegestalt.com/en/posts/holistic-reflection-bullet-journal/#:~:text=The%20Bullet%20Journal%20method%20meets,journal%20into%20your%20life%20to)[eljardindegestalt.com](https://eljardindegestalt.com/en/posts/holistic-reflection-bullet-journal/#:~:text=all%20the%20pages%20of%20the,you%20an%20accurate%20overview%20of).
  Some find the manual migration tedious, but that is by design to
  enforce decision-making.

- **Mode evolution:** The method explicitly supports evolving entries:
  e.g. a note captured in daily log can be evolved into a longer
  "collection" if it needs a dedicated space. **No digital automation**
  -- the user's attention is the mechanism for mode switching (e.g. a
  calendar reminder to do the monthly migration).

- **Comparison:** Unlike apps that just roll over unfinished tasks
  automatically, Bullet Journal's **manual migration mode** creates a
  mindful pause to decide if a task still
  matters[eljardindegestalt.com](https://eljardindegestalt.com/en/posts/holistic-reflection-bullet-journal/#:~:text=The%20monthly%20migration%20consists%20of,don%E2%80%99t%20leave%20any%20loose%20ends)[tinyrayofsunshine.com](https://www.tinyrayofsunshine.com/blog/migration#:~:text=,%E2%80%9D).
  Compared to a simple to-do list, it intermixes a journal and
  reflection, engaging both "planner mode" and "journal mode" in one
  system.

- **Unique/philosophical aspects:** Emphasizes **intentionality through
  writing**. It's essentially an **external cognitive framework**: one
  mode for externalizing thoughts quickly, another for internalizing and
  learning from them. Ryder Carroll calls it "closing the loop" -- you
  must process what you wrote, not just keep accumulating tasks.

- **Related theories:** Ties into principles of **cognitive offloading**
  (getting things out of your head onto paper) and **reflection in
  learning** (akin to Kolb's reflective observation). The routine of
  migration echoes CBT techniques of reviewing thoughts to challenge or
  confirm their importance (though applied to tasks).

**3. Pomodoro Technique (Focus Mode vs. Break Mode)**

- **What it is:** A **time management method** where work is split into
  focused sprints and short breaks. A timer is used to enforce a
  **dedicated focus mode** (traditionally 25 minutes, called one
  "pomodoro") followed by a **break mode** (5
  minutes)[todoist.com](https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique#:~:text=The%20Pomodoro%20Technique%20is%20a,love%20this%20method%20because%20it).
  After 4 cycles, a longer break is taken.

- **Modal structure:** **Pre-defined temporal modes**: a **Work
  interval** (no distractions, single-task focus) and a **Break
  interval** (relax, step away). These alternate rhythmically. The user
  only concentrates on a task during the work mode, and must stop (even
  mid-task) when the timer rings, switching to rest.

- **Interface/experience:** Typically aided by a **timer app or device**
  (the original method used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer). Many apps
  (Todoist, Forest, Pomofocus, etc.) provide a countdown clock and
  distinct audio/visual cues when modes switch. During focus mode, apps
  often **block interruptions** or at least show a ticking clock to
  create urgency. During break mode, some apps gray out the task list or
  play relaxing animations to encourage stepping back.

- **User benefits:** Boosts productivity by **reducing mental fatigue**
  and procrastination. The fixed focus interval makes daunting work feel
  manageable ("I just need to do 25
  minutes")[todoist.com](https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique#:~:text=).
  Frequent breaks ensure **sustained concentration** over longer
  periods[todoist.com](https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique#:~:text=This%20popular%20time%20management%20method,and%20stave%20off%20mental%20fatigue)[todoist.com](https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique#:~:text=The%20Pomodoro%20Technique%20is%20a,love%20this%20method%20because%20it).
  It also helps train attention -- users report improved ability to
  ignore distractions knowing a break is coming soon.

- **Use cases:** Anyone with large or open-ended work (students
  studying, programmers coding, writers, etc.) who struggles with
  distractions. Pomodoro is beloved by **students, writers, and remote
  workers**. It's also used in **pair programming** or team settings
  (some teams do group Pomodoro sessions to synchronize work/rest).
  Target audience: those seeking structure to enter a "flow" state yet
  avoid burnout.

- **UX feedback:** Generally very positive -- millions use it. Users
  love the gamified element (each Pomodoro is an achievement) and the
  **"finish line" effect** that increases
  focus[lifeat.io](https://lifeat.io/blog/the-science-behind-the-pomodoro-timer-method-why-it-works-for-deep-focus#:~:text=The%20Science%20Behind%20the%20Pomodoro,actual%20work%20rather%20than).
  Research has found it **reduces decision fatigue** since you don't
  constantly decide when to take
  breaks[pomofocus.io](https://pomofocus.io/#:~:text=minutes%20in%20length%2C%20separated%20by,is%20known%20as%20a).
  Some advanced users customize interval lengths (e.g. 50/10 minutes) if
  25 is too short/long for
  them[susanshu.com](https://www.susanshu.com/pomodoro-break-time-importance-impact#:~:text=The%20importance%20of%20taking%20breaks,to%20cause%20noticeable%20mental%20fatigue).

- **Mode support:** Virtually every productivity app now has a Pomodoro
  timer or integration. Some apps go further -- e.g. integrating with
  task lists to auto-start a break when a task is done, or pausing your
  music during break. **Physical timers** also serve as an external
  trigger to switch modes.

- **Comparison:** Compared to working continuously, Pomodoro enforces
  **structured switching between work and rest**, which has proven
  benefits for attention span. Unlike merely "remembering to take
  breaks," the timer makes it non-negotiable, leveraging a bit of
  pressure (the ticking clock) to enhance
  focus[todoist.com](https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique#:~:text=).
  Versus multi-tasking, it advocates monotasking strictly within the
  timebox.

- **Unique aspects:** The name (Italian for tomato) and simplicity make
  it catchy. It's essentially a **mode-switching ritual** -- the ringing
  timer acts as a **modal boundary** between mental states. Over time,
  your brain gets conditioned: bell = permission to relax, ticking =
  time to dive in.

- **Theory:** Draws on **ultradian rhythm** concepts (natural cycles of
  high/low alertness) and **attention restoration** theory (brief breaks
  can recharge focus). It also combats Parkinson's Law (work expands to
  fill time) by creating artificial deadlines every 25 minutes.

**4. Apple iOS/iPadOS Focus Modes (Customized Device Modes)**

- **What it is:** A feature in Apple's mobile OS (iOS 15+ and macOS)
  that lets users create **named modes for different contexts** (e.g.
  Work, Sleep, Personal, Driving) to control notifications, apps, and
  Home Screen layouts
  accordingly[popsci.com](https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-customize-iphone-focus-mode/#:~:text=The%20idea%20is%20you%20set,many%20distractions%20are%20allowed%20through)[popsci.com](https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-customize-iphone-focus-mode/#:~:text=Setting%20up%20iPhone%20Focus%20modes).
  Essentially, your phone **behavior and UI adapt** to support the
  mental mode you're in.

- **Modal structure:** **User-defined modes** (some presets like Do Not
  Disturb, Work, Sleep, Driving are given, and you can add custom ones).
  Each Focus mode has configurable settings: which people/apps can
  notify you, a specific Home Screen (pages of apps) to show, lock
  screen options, etc. Modes can be activated manually or via
  schedules/automation (time, location, app
  trigger)[popsci.com](https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-customize-iphone-focus-mode/#:~:text=Besides%20being%20scheduled%2C%20Focus%20modes,Tap%20the%20Focus%20modes)[popsci.com](https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-customize-iphone-focus-mode/#:~:text=You%20don%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20make,you%20can%20choose%20a%20name).

- **Interface behavior:** When a Focus mode is on, the device visibly
  indicates it (e.g. a status bar icon and lock screen
  label)[popsci.com](https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-customize-iphone-focus-mode/#:~:text=match%20at%20L229%20Whenever%20a,Focus%20page%20in%20Settings%2C%20then).
  Only the allowed app icons appear on the Home Screen (others are
  hidden to reduce
  temptation[popsci.com](https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-customize-iphone-focus-mode/#:~:text=match%20at%20L184%20There%20are,glance%20indication%20of%20when%20a)).
  Notifications from disallowed apps are silenced. For example, in
  **Work mode**, you might only see email, calendar, and work apps on
  your home screen and get no social media
  pings[popsci.com](https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-customize-iphone-focus-mode/#:~:text=The%20idea%20is%20you%20set,many%20distractions%20are%20allowed%20through).
  In **Sleep mode**, the lock screen could dim and widgets like clock or
  meditation appear. The UI thus reinforces the context: fewer
  distractions for work, or a minimal grayscale screen for bedtime.

- **User benefits:** **Reduces distraction and context-switching** in
  daily
  life[popsci.com](https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-customize-iphone-focus-mode/#:~:text=The%20idea%20is%20you%20set,many%20distractions%20are%20allowed%20through)[popsci.com](https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-customize-iphone-focus-mode/#:~:text=These%20Focus%20modes%20are%20simple,you%20give%20to%20your%20phone).
  Users can maintain better work-life balance (e.g. Personal mode hides
  work emails at home). It helps **mindful smartphone use** -- e.g. a
  Focus mode for studying filters out everything except educational
  apps. By filtering notifications and even visual clutter, it supports
  the user's intended mental mode (focus, relaxation, driving safely,
  etc.).

- **Use cases:** **Professionals or students** who want to
  compartmentalize phone usage (work vs personal), **drivers** (Driving
  Focus auto-replies to texts and shows maps), **sleep hygiene** (Sleep
  Focus to wind down at night), **fitness** (a Workout mode for music +
  fitness apps only), etc. Practically anyone can use it since
  smartphones are universal -- target audience ranges from busy
  executives to teens trying to limit social media during homework.

- **UX feedback:** Generally positive, though it requires some setup.
  Users appreciate the **personalization** ("I love having a Writing
  mode that only lets through my notes app and a lo-fi playlist"). Many
  find it surprisingly effective: *"Focus modes can help. The idea is
  you set up different modes for different scenarios... each mode sets
  certain rules about notifications and how many distractions are
  allowed
  through."*[popsci.com](https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-customize-iphone-focus-mode/#:~:text=The%20idea%20is%20you%20set,many%20distractions%20are%20allowed%20through).
  The ability to link a custom Home Screen to a mode is praised for
  visual reinforcement. There is a learning curve (some initially missed
  important calls because they forgot Focus was on). Overall it's seen
  as a powerful **"digital boundary"** tool.

- **Mode switching:** Apple supports **automatic switching** -- e.g.
  Sleep mode on a schedule or Driving mode via car Bluetooth. Also, a
  Control Center toggle lets users switch modes quickly. Modes can
  trigger across devices (turn on Work Focus on iPhone, it can sync to
  Mac). Apple's use of AI suggestions (it might prompt adding a Focus
  based on routine) is an attempt to help mode management.

- **Comparison:** Versus the earlier simple *"Do Not Disturb"*, Focus is
  more granular and context-specific. Competing platforms: Android has
  similar features (see Digital Wellbeing below) but Apple's integration
  with Home Screen layouts is
  distinctive[popsci.com](https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-customize-iphone-focus-mode/#:~:text=match%20at%20L184%20There%20are,glance%20indication%20of%20when%20a).
  Compared to manually silencing apps or using app timers, Focus is
  broader -- it changes the **whole phone's ambiance** to match your
  mindset.

- **Unique aspects:** The tie-in with **custom home pages** is unique:
  you can essentially have multiple "phones in one" -- e.g. a **Work
  phone vs. Leisure phone** -- and swap between by
  mode[support.apple.com](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/set-up-a-focus-iphd6288a67f/ios#:~:text=Set%20up%20a%20Focus%20on,Note%3A)[popsci.com](https://www.popsci.com/diy/how-to-customize-iphone-focus-mode/#:~:text=match%20at%20L184%20There%20are,glance%20indication%20of%20when%20a).
  It also introduced the concept of **status sharing** -- people who
  Message you see a note that you have notifications silenced (reducing
  pressure to reply immediately).

- **Theories:** Aligns with **context-dependent memory** (setting up
  consistent context can improve focus) and digital minimalism ideas.
  It's an implementation of **situation-based self-control**,
  acknowledging that we behave differently in different roles and need
  our tools to support those role shifts.

**5. Android Digital Wellbeing Modes (Focus Mode, Bedtime Mode, Work
Profile)**

- **What it is:** Google's Android platform offers a suite of "Digital
  Wellbeing" features to help users manage their attention and downtime.
  Key modal features include **Focus Mode** (pauses distracting apps),
  **Bedtime Mode** (wind-down at night), and **Work Profile** (separates
  work
  apps/data)[android.com](https://www.android.com/digital-wellbeing/#:~:text=Focus%20mode)[android.com](https://www.android.com/digital-wellbeing/#:~:text=Work%20Profile).
  Each creates a phone environment suited to a particular mental mode
  (productivity, sleep, personal life).

- **Modal structure:** These are **pre-defined context modes**:

  - **Focus Mode:** The user selects which apps are "distracting" (e.g.
    social media, games). Turning on Focus Mode instantly *grays out*
    those apps and blocks their
    notifications[internetmatters.org](https://www.internetmatters.org/parental-controls/smartphones-and-other-devices/digital-wellbeing/#:~:text=Digital%20Wellbeing%20screen%20time%20tool,Turn%20on%20now%20or)[android.com](https://www.android.com/digital-wellbeing/#:~:text=Focus%20on%20what%E2%80%99s%20in%20front,of%20you).
    You can schedule it (e.g. 9am-5pm weekdays).

  - **Bedtime Mode:** At a set time (or when charging overnight), it
    switches the phone to grayscale (removing color stimulation) and
    silences all but priority
    calls[android.com](https://www.android.com/digital-wellbeing/#:~:text=Quiet%20your%20phone%20for%20better,sleep).
    It's often paired with **Do Not Disturb** at night and can turn on
    Night Light (warmer screen tint).

  - **Work Profile:** Primarily for enterprise users, it creates a
    separate profile for work apps. When toggled off, all work apps and
    notifications are hidden, effectively putting the device in
    "personal
    mode"[android.com](https://www.android.com/digital-wellbeing/#:~:text=Separate%20work%20from%20home).

- **Interface behavior:** In **Focus Mode**, disallowed apps appear
  **grayed-out on the launcher** (trying to open them shows a reminder
  that Focus Mode is
  on)[pcworld.com](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393989/6-ways-to-stop-using-your-android-phone-before-bedtime.html#:~:text=6%20ways%20to%20stop%20using,is%20a%20good%20option).
  Notifications from those apps are paused. The Quick Settings menu has
  a cactus icon for Focus Mode (with animations if you try to open
  blocked apps). **Bedtime Mode** often triggers grayscale screen and
  DND; some phones show a "Bedtime" banner. In **Work Profile**, work
  apps have a briefcase icon and disappear when the profile is off, and
  a toggle in Quick Settings switches profiles.

- **User benefits:** They provide **one-tap control over digital
  distractions**. Focus Mode is great for deep work or study -- you're
  not even tempted by certain apps since they're effectively
  gone[android.com](https://www.android.com/digital-wellbeing/#:~:text=Focus%20on%20what%E2%80%99s%20in%20front,of%20you).
  Bedtime mode **removes blue light and pings that could keep you up**,
  training a nightly ritual (screen turns gray as a signal to
  sleep)[android.com](https://www.android.com/digital-wellbeing/#:~:text=Quiet%20your%20phone%20for%20better,sleep).
  Work Profile helps **work-life balance**, preventing after-hours work
  intrusion.

- **Use cases:** **Students** use Focus Mode to block YouTube/TikTok
  during class or homework. **Professionals** use it to focus during
  meetings or coding. **Anyone** can use Bedtime Mode as part of a
  healthier sleep routine. **Enterprise employees** or anyone using one
  phone for both work and personal life rely on Work Profile to
  compartmentalize. It's especially useful in remote work to "leave the
  office" at day's end by toggling off work.

- **UX feedback:** Focus Mode has been applauded as "simple but
  effective" -- users say it *"pauses apps by closing them in the
  background, graying out the icon, and hiding their notifications.
  Focus Mode is a good
  option\..."*[pcworld.com](https://www.pcworld.com/article/393989/6-ways-to-stop-using-your-android-phone-before-bedtime.html#:~:text=6%20ways%20to%20stop%20using,is%20a%20good%20option)
  to stay on task. Bedtime mode is often set-and-forget; people notice
  they sleep better when not glancing at a colorful screen at midnight.
  These features tend to have **high adoption among those aware of
  them**, though some casual users might not realize they exist.
  Overall, they're considered essential well-being tools on Android.

- **Mode switching:** All can be automated. E.g., Focus Mode can follow
  a schedule or be toggled via Google Assistant. Bedtime can be
  scheduled or triggered by charging the phone at night. Work Profile
  can auto-disable on evenings/weekends. The automation ensures modes
  activate during the intended context without relying on user
  willpower.

- **Comparison:** Compared to Apple's Focus, Android's Focus Mode is a
  bit more limited (it's mainly about app blocking, without custom home
  screens)[android.com](https://www.android.com/digital-wellbeing/#:~:text=Focus%20on%20what%E2%80%99s%20in%20front,of%20you).
  However, Android's Bedtime mode turning the screen gray is a
  distinctive approach (Apple uses "Sleep Focus" but doesn't force
  grayscale). Work Profile is an Android strength -- iOS doesn't have an
  equivalent full work/personal separation at OS level.

- **Unique aspects:** The strong **visual indicator of Focus Mode
  (grayed icons)** is a clever behavioral nudge -- it's a constant
  reminder you're in focus mode, which can prevent mindless taps.
  Bedtime's grayscale is similarly unique in taking advantage of human
  psychology (color draws attention; removing it reduces phone
  engagement at night).

- **Theory:** Based on principles of **stimulus control** (reducing cues
  that trigger distractions) and **habit formation** (automatic
  schedules). Work Profile leverages **context-dependent memory** --
  when work apps aren't visible, you think about work less, helping you
  mentally disconnect.

quiet hours (grayscale screen and silenced notifications) for sleep.*

**6. Amplenote (Idea Execution Funnel: Jots Mode vs. Notes Mode)**

- **What it is:** Amplenote is a productivity and note-taking app that
  explicitly supports moving ideas from rough to polished in **two
  stages**. It provides a **"Jots" mode for quick capture** of
  unstructured thoughts, and a **"Notes" mode for editing and
  organizing** those thoughts into shareable
  form[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=In%20Amplenote%2C%20every%20,%EF%BB%BF)[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=Jots%20is%20great%20when%20you%27re,is%20where%20Notes%20mode%20shines).
  This aligns with the cognitive modes of **ideation vs. refinement**.

- **Modal structure:** **Two user-selectable modes** in the sidebar:
  **Jots** and
  **Notes**[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=Writing%20in%20Amplenote%20happens%20primarily,Notes).
  Every item is technically a note, but viewing it in Jots mode or Notes
  mode changes the editing experience and intended usage. **Jots Mode**
  is the first step in an "Idea Execution Funnel" (capture → refine →
  complete)[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=In%20Amplenote%2C%20every%20,%EF%BB%BF).
  Users can later tag or schedule notes, but the primary structure is
  this two-tier funnel.

- **Interface behavior:** In **Jots mode**, the UI is intentionally
  minimal -- a distraction-free editor with *no formatting toolbar* by
  default[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20,facilitate%20simple%2C%20quick%20idea%20capture).
  This encourages you to jot down raw text quickly (similar to a
  scratchpad). It's often used for daily notes or brain dumps. In
  **Notes mode**, the full range of formatting tools, tags, and options
  appear[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=where%20Notes%20mode%20shines)[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20,facilitate%20simple%2C%20quick%20idea%20capture).
  The sidebar highlights which mode you're in (Jots vs Notes) and
  separates content accordingly. Typically, a user might start writing
  an idea in Jots (quick bullet points or sentences) and later switch
  that note into Notes mode to flesh it out with structure, attachments,
  and
  polish[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=Jots%20is%20great%20when%20you%27re,is%20where%20Notes%20mode%20shines).

- **User benefits:** By splitting the writing process, Amplenote **lets
  you capture ideas without friction or self-editing (in Jots) and then
  systematically process them (in
  Notes)**[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=In%20Amplenote%2C%20every%20,%EF%BB%BF)[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=Notes%20mode%20,consumed%20by%20the%20outside%20world).
  This mirrors creative best practices (brainstorm first, edit later).
  The benefit is you don't get bogged down polishing text when you
  should be ideating. Users also report that Jots mode, being sparse,
  helps them focus when dumping thoughts, whereas Notes mode feels like
  a separate "publication" phase -- this **mental separation reduces
  anxiety** about ideas needing to be perfect from the start.

- **Use cases:** **Writers and thinkers** love this for drafting. For
  example, an author might free-write a scene in Jots mode, then switch
  to Notes mode to format it properly. **Productivity enthusiasts** use
  Jots as a daily log or inbox (similar to GTD capture), then promote
  important items to formal notes or tasks. It's also useful in
  **meetings**: jot quick minutes, later refine into structured notes.

- **UX feedback:** Amplenote users often cite the Jots/Notes distinction
  as a killer feature. It feels natural: *"Jots is great when you're
  first sketching out an idea... a zero-clutter place to write. But when
  you want to share your ideas with the world... this is where Notes
  mode
  shines."*[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20,facilitate%20simple%2C%20quick%20idea%20capture)[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=Jots%20is%20great%20when%20you%27re,is%20where%20Notes%20mode%20shines).
  The app's philosophy of an idea funnel resonates with users who have
  lots of fragments to assemble. Some say it's like having an
  **automatic rough draft bin**. A potential downside is new users might
  not immediately grasp when to use which mode, but the learning is
  quick.

- **Mode evolution:** You can seamlessly turn a jot into a note (since
  they're the same object). Amplenote supports **moving items along the
  funnel** -- e.g. applying tags/deadlines in Notes mode that wouldn't
  be done in Jots. It also has **"Quick Capture" integrations** (web
  clipper, email to note) that feed into Jots mode by
  default[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#:~:text=In%20Amplenote%2C%20every%20,%EF%BB%BF).
  Thus, it actively channels inputs into the right mode.

- **Comparison:** Traditional note apps like Evernote/OneNote have one
  mode for all notes, or at most a "snippet" vs full note concept.
  Amplenote's Jots is more structured than a simple sticky note, but
  less formal than a normal note. It could be compared to Roam's daily
  notes vs permanent notes, but Amplenote formalized it as two modes in
  the UI. Compared to just tagging something as "draft," the dedicated
  mode actually *changes the interface* to suit the purpose (e.g. no
  rich text controls in
  jot)[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20,facilitate%20simple%2C%20quick%20idea%20capture).

- **Unique aspects:** Amplenote explicitly references cognitive workflow
  ("Idea Execution
  Funnel")[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=In%20Amplenote%2C%20every%20,%EF%BB%BF).
  It's unique in making an **ideation mode a first-class part of the
  app**, rather than expecting the user to manage drafts themselves.
  Philosophically, it recognizes that **"the brain has different modes
  for creating vs. polishing"** and builds that into the UX.

- **Supporting theories:** Echoes the concept of **separation of
  creative and critical thinking** in writing (similar to freewriting
  then editing). Also parallels **GTD's Capture & Clarify** steps (Jots
  = capture, Notes = clarify/organize), suggesting a generalizable
  principle that workflows benefit from a collection mode and a
  processing mode.

**7. Scrivener (Writers' Toolkit with Writing vs. Organizing Modes)**

- **What it is:** Scrivener is a popular writing software (Literature &
  Latte) designed for long-form writing (novels, research, scripts). It
  provides multiple views or "modes" to approach your manuscript: a
  **Corkboard mode** (index card storyboard), an **Outliner mode**
  (structured outline with metadata), and the standard **Document editor
  mode** (continuous
  text)[literatureandlatte.com](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/integrating-scriveners-binder-corkboard-and-outliner#:~:text=All%20three%20of%20Scrivener%E2%80%99s%20tools,that%20works%20best%20for%20you)[literatureandlatte.com](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/integrating-scriveners-binder-corkboard-and-outliner#:~:text=While%20you%20do%20all%20your,thinking%20of%20you%2C%20Jack%20Kerouac).
  These modes let writers switch between **creative drafting and
  structural planning** easily.

- **Modal structure:** The program isn't modal in the lock-in sense (you
  can always edit text), but the UI has **distinct workspaces**:

  - **Editor (Scrivenings) Mode:** where you write and edit the text
    sequentially.

  - **Corkboard Mode:** visualizes selected parts as index cards on a
    board -- used for brainstorming scene order or story
    beats[literatureandlatte.com](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/organize-your-scrivener-project-with-the-corkboard#:~:text=Using%20the%20Corkboard).

  - **Outliner Mode:** shows the hierarchy of documents with synopsis,
    word counts, custom metadata columns -- used for planning and global
    edits[literatureandlatte.com](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/integrating-scriveners-binder-corkboard-and-outliner#:~:text=While%20you%20do%20all%20your,thinking%20of%20you%2C%20Jack%20Kerouac).\
    You toggle these via toolbar buttons. Essentially, **planning mode
    vs. writing mode** are a click away.

- **Interface behavior:** In **Corkboard**, the editor pane turns into a
  board with cards; you can drag cards to reorder scenes and jot ideas
  on each card's
  synopsis[literatureandlatte.com](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/organize-your-scrivener-project-with-the-corkboard#:~:text=The%20Scrivener%20corkboard%20is%20designed,to%20write%20on%20their%20computers).
  In **Outliner**, the editor pane becomes a spreadsheet-like list of
  your sections, where you can adjust structure or overview your
  project. In **Scrivenings (text) mode**, it's a normal rich text
  editor. The Binder (sidebar) remains constant, but selection in binder
  is shown differently depending on mode. This allows, for example, a
  writer to **brainstorm non-linearly on the Corkboard ("arrange and
  rearrange virtual index
  cards")[literatureandlatte.com](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/organize-your-scrivener-project-with-the-corkboard#:~:text=Now%20it%E2%80%99s%20time%20to%20look,to%20work%20with%20the%20Corkboard)**,
  then instantly switch to the text mode to write a scene, then to
  Outliner to check chapter lengths.

- **User benefits:** Writers can **separate the creative flow of writing
  from the analytical task of organizing**. When you're wearing your
  "writer hat," you work in the editor without being distracted by
  big-picture structure. When you need "architect mode," Corkboard or
  Outliner give a zoomed-out view. This **modal thinking prevents
  overwhelm** -- you can focus on one chapter in the editor, or step
  back and just deal with summaries on cards when
  plotting[literatureandlatte.com](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/organize-your-scrivener-project-with-the-corkboard#:~:text=Scrivener%E2%80%99s%20Corkboard%20is%20a%20powerful,projects%2C%20from%20brainstorming%20to%20editing).
  It encourages better organization because Scrivener makes structure
  explicit and malleable (far easier than shuffling Word documents).

- **Use cases:** **Novelists and screenwriters** use Corkboard to plot
  scenes and Outliner to manage chapters/acts. **Researchers** might use
  Outliner mode to organize topics and sources, then text mode to fill
  in content. Essentially any complex writing project benefits -- the
  target audience is serious writers who have to juggle creative writing
  and structural planning.

- **UX feedback:** Scrivener is praised for **"allowing you to plan and
  organize your projects... choose the tool that works best for
  you"**[literatureandlatte.com](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/integrating-scriveners-binder-corkboard-and-outliner#:~:text=All%20three%20of%20Scrivener%E2%80%99s%20tools,that%20works%20best%20for%20you).
  Users love the Corkboard's tactile feel ("like an analog corkboard,
  but linked to your draft"); it's great for **brainstorming to
  editing**
  transitions[literatureandlatte.com](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/organize-your-scrivener-project-with-the-corkboard#:~:text=Scrivener%E2%80%99s%20Corkboard%20is%20a%20powerful,projects%2C%20from%20brainstorming%20to%20editing)[literatureandlatte.com](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/organize-your-scrivener-project-with-the-corkboard#:~:text=Using%20the%20Corkboard).
  Some find the plethora of modes and features initially overwhelming --
  there's a learning curve. But most agree that once learned, the
  ability to switch perspectives is a huge productivity booster. It's
  often cited as helping overcome writer's block (you can fiddle with
  index cards if prose isn't flowing).

- **Mode support:** Scrivener makes switching trivial (one click or
  keyboard shortcut). All views are kept in sync (reordering cards
  updates the manuscript order, etc.). This tight integration means
  mode-switching is fluid and encouraged frequently. There's also a
  **Full Screen Composition mode** for distraction-free writing --
  another modal shift (UI fades away to just text).

- **Comparison:** Standard word processors (Word, Google Docs) have
  minimal support for this -- perhaps outline view, but nothing as rich
  as Scrivener's corkboard. Many writers used to use physical index
  cards or separate outlining software; Scrivener consolidates it,
  eliminating the friction between "modes." Compared to its competitor
  yWriter or Ulysses, Scrivener is more modal and feature-rich (some
  love that, some prefer simpler).

- **Unique aspects:** It embodies the philosophy that **writing is not a
  single mode activity; it alternates between creative writing,
  structuring, and reviewing**. Scrivener basically gives a dedicated
  space/interface to each of these, acknowledging the mindset shift. The
  Corkboard is literally **modeled after real-world modal thinking
  tools** (index cards for
  brainstorming)[literatureandlatte.com](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/organize-your-scrivener-project-with-the-corkboard#:~:text=Using%20the%20Corkboard).

- **Theory:** This aligns with **dual-process writing theories** --
  generative vs evaluative modes in writing. It externalizes the
  "spatial thinking" process (corkboard for story structure) vs. "linear
  thinking" (document writing). Also, by chunking text into sections, it
  facilitates a **modular approach** to a large project, easing
  cognitive load.

**8. Eclipse IDE Perspectives (Coding vs. Debugging Modes)**

- **What it is:** Eclipse, a software development IDE, uses the concept
  of **"perspectives"** to reconfigure the UI for different developer
  tasks. For example, a **Java Perspective** for writing code and a
  **Debug Perspective** for debugging
  programs[eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/june/article1.php#:~:text=because%20it%20helps%20to%20find,developer%20debug%20effectively%20and%20efficiently)[eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/june/article1.php#:~:text=The%20debug%20perspective%20offers%20additional,switch%20to%20the%20debug%20perspective).
  Each perspective is like a mode that shows/hides relevant tools.

- **Modal structure:** **Pre-defined perspectives** (Java, Debug, Git,
  etc.) which users can switch. When you start debugging, Eclipse
  prompts to switch to the Debug
  perspective[eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/june/article1.php#:~:text=The%20debug%20perspective%20offers%20additional,switch%20to%20the%20debug%20perspective).
  Users can also create custom perspectives. Each perspective specifies
  which views (panels) and toolbars are open and how they're arranged.

- **Interface behavior:** In **Debug perspective**, the interface shows
  views like call stack, variables, breakpoints, and console, instead of
  the usual code editor-centric
  layout[eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/june/article1.php#:~:text=The%20debug%20perspective%20offers%20additional,switch%20to%20the%20debug%20perspective).
  The editor panel still exists, but perhaps smaller while a Variables
  panel is front and center, for instance. When you return to the **Java
  perspective**, those debug panels disappear and you see the package
  explorer, code editor, etc. The switch can be automatic (when hitting
  a breakpoint, it asks to open Debug view) or manual via a menu. A user
  can tell which perspective they're in by an indicator on the toolbar.

- **User benefits:** This provides **cognitive scaffolding** for complex
  tasks. In coding mode, you're not distracted by irrelevant windows; in
  debug mode, you have all necessary info to trace program
  execution[eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/june/article1.php#:~:text=The%20debug%20perspective%20offers%20additional,switch%20to%20the%20debug%20perspective).
  It effectively **modes the IDE to the developer's current mental
  context** (writing vs troubleshooting). This separation improves
  efficiency -- no need to manually open/close a dozen panels each time
  you debug; the IDE "remembers" what you need in that
  mode[eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/june/article1.php#:~:text=because%20it%20helps%20to%20find,developer%20debug%20effectively%20and%20efficiently)[eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/june/article1.php#:~:text=The%20debug%20perspective%20offers%20additional,switch%20to%20the%20debug%20perspective).

- **Use cases:** **Software developers** using Eclipse or similar IDEs.
  When writing new code (design/implement mode), they stay in the coding
  perspective. When a bug arises or tests fail, they switch to debugging
  perspective to step through code. Other perspectives like Database or
  UI designer could apply in other contexts. The concept is general in
  IDEs (Visual Studio has modes, IntelliJ has "layouts" for debugging,
  etc.), but Eclipse popularized it.

- **UX feedback:** Experienced users appreciate not having to "fight the
  UI" -- the IDE adapts to the task. For novices, the perspective switch
  prompt (on first debug) is a bit confusing, but once understood, it's
  logical. It's often highlighted in Eclipse tutorials that **"the
  Eclipse Java IDE provides many debugging tools and views grouped in
  the Debug Perspective to help you debug
  effectively"**[eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/june/article1.php#:~:text=because%20it%20helps%20to%20find,developer%20debug%20effectively%20and%20efficiently)[eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org/community/eclipse_newsletter/2017/june/article1.php#:~:text=The%20debug%20perspective%20offers%20additional,switch%20to%20the%20debug%20perspective).
  That grouping is seen as a major advantage over simpler editors.

- **Mode evolution:** Users can customize what each perspective contains
  (add or remove views) and Eclipse will remember that configuration
  next time. Also, it can auto-switch perspectives on certain triggers
  (launch debug = debug perspective). This is a mature system, so it
  even supports saving perspective layouts to restore later, etc.

- **Comparison:** Simpler code editors (VS Code, Sublime) often rely on
  manually opening panels or extensions for different tasks, whereas
  Eclipse's perspectives are an integrated, one-click environment
  change. It resembles how Photoshop has workspaces for photography vs
  painting. Some find perspectives too rigid, but they enforce a clean
  separation of concerns which many find improves focus.

- **Unique aspects:** It was one of the early UI paradigms in IDEs to
  acknowledge that **developers have multiple workflows**. It basically
  made "mode" a top-level concept in a UI that is otherwise
  document-centric. The philosophy could be stated as: an IDE should
  support **"modal multitasking"** -- you multitask by switching modes,
  not piling everything on one screen.

- **Theory:** Ties to **human factors in programming** -- reducing the
  cognitive load by only presenting relevant info for the task at hand.
  Also an example of **context-sensitive UI** (mode-dependent
  interface), which can improve usability if the context detection is
  correct.

**9. Figma (Design vs. Prototype vs. Inspect Modes in UI Design)**

- **What it is:** Figma is a collaborative UI/UX design tool. It offers
  a primary **Design mode** for creating graphics/interface elements, a
  **Prototype mode** for defining interactive flows between screens, and
  an **Inspect (Dev) mode** for developers to get code snippets and
  specs. These modes let teams **transition from static design to
  interactive prototype to development handoff** all in one tool.

- **Modal structure:** **Tabs at the top** toggle between *Design*,
  *Prototype*, and (recently) *Dev* (or Inspect) modes for any selected
  frame. The canvas and right sidebar adjust according to mode. For
  example, in Prototype mode you can draw connections between frames
  (representing clickable hotspots), whereas in Design mode those
  connections are hidden and you edit the visuals.

- **Interface behavior:** In **Design mode**, all vector editing tools,
  alignment options, layer styles, etc. are active. **Prototype mode**
  changes the right-hand panel to interaction settings (transitions,
  animations) and shows connecting arrows when an object is linked to
  another frame as a
  hotspot[help.figma.com](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193-Guide-to-prototyping-in-Figma#:~:text=Tip%21%20For%20an%20even%20more,E).
  The canvas can simulate how screens connect. **Dev mode (Inspect)**
  highlights CSS properties, color values, and distances, catering to
  developers' needs. The mode switch is obvious (the button is
  highlighted, and the icon changes). It's easy to quickly **"toggle
  between Design and Prototype tabs using the
  shortcut"**[help.figma.com](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193-Guide-to-prototyping-in-Figma#:~:text=Tip%21%20For%20an%20even%20more,E)
  to test flow then tweak design.

- **User benefits:** Designers can **think in different modalities**
  without leaving Figma. For creative layout work, design mode gives
  full freedom. When ready to consider user experience flow, prototype
  mode lets them **step into the user's shoes** and ensure the
  interactions make sense, without the clutter of design tools. For
  developers or design reviewers, inspect mode surfaces the technical
  details needed. This prevents context-switching to other software --
  one can go from artboard design to an interactive clickable mockup in
  seconds, which **streamlines the iterative
  process**[help.figma.com](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193-Guide-to-prototyping-in-Figma#:~:text=Figma%E2%80%99s%20prototyping%20features%20allow%20you,may%20interact%20with%20your%20designs)[help.figma.com](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193-Guide-to-prototyping-in-Figma#:~:text=Tip%21%20For%20an%20even%20more,E).

- **Use cases:** **UX/UI design teams** use Figma throughout the product
  design cycle. A common workflow: design screens (Design mode), then
  link them and do a quick user test or stakeholder demo (Prototype
  mode's presentation view), then developers use the same file in Dev
  mode to get specs. It's also educational -- design students can learn
  interaction design easier. The target is anyone designing digital
  interfaces.

- **UX feedback:** Figma's unified modes have been a major selling
  point. Users love that *"Figma has the Prototype feature which lets
  you create nice clickable wireframes (an actual version of the
  product)"*[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductManagement/comments/1cloigq/is_figma_enough_for_prototyping_or_is_there_any/#:~:text=Is%20Figma%20enough%20for%20prototyping,actual%20version%20of%20the%20product)
  directly from the design, rather than using a separate tool like
  InVision. The mode switching is smooth and feels like a natural
  extension of the design process. The only caution is ensuring you're
  in the right mode when editing (occasionally someone tries to edit an
  object while still in prototype mode and ends up drawing a connection
  by mistake). Overall, it's considered highly intuitive: design teams
  appreciate not having to export to another platform for prototyping.

- **Mode support:** Figma's viewer can also **play the prototype** in a
  presentation mode (essentially a "user mode"), which is separate from
  the edit modes. Also, Figma recently added **"Dev Mode"** which is
  like an enhanced Inspect for developers with additional features --
  acknowledging that even within development handoff, there's a mode
  that changes how the interface works (e.g., easier asset export, code
  preview).

- **Comparison:** Older design workflows required **multiple tools**
  (Photoshop for visuals, then something like Axure or InVision for
  prototyping). Figma collapsed these into one via modes. Compared to
  Sketch (which introduced an "Prototype" plugin later) or Adobe XD
  (which has a similar mode toggle), Figma's real-time collaboration in
  any mode is a plus. It stands out for how seamlessly one can go from
  static to interactive.

- **Unique aspects:** It's a prime example of **mode as workspace** --
  each mode caters to a different audience too (designers vs.
  stakeholders vs. developers) yet all operate on the same source file.
  Philosophically, it treats design not as a single phase but as a
  multi-modal activity (visual design *and* interaction design *and*
  implementation details), giving each its proper UI.

- **Theory:** This aligns with the notion of **interactive cognition**
  in design -- designers mentally simulate user flows, and Figma's
  Prototype mode externalizes that simulation. It's also influenced by
  **human-computer interaction principles**: mode indicators are clear,
  and each mode's controls are contextual, which is crucial to avoid the
  pitfalls of "modes" causing user error.

**10. Miro (Online Whiteboard with Facilitation Modes)**

- **What it is:** Miro is a collaborative online whiteboard platform
  often used for workshops, brainstorming, and retrospectives. It
  includes special **facilitation features** like **Private Mode**
  (hides others' contributions), **Voting Mode**, and **Timer Mode** to
  structure collaborative sessions. These act as modes that guide
  participants through different phases of a meeting (idea generation,
  voting/prioritization, etc.).

- **Modal structure:** **Facilitator-triggered modes**:

  - **Private Mode:** When enabled on a board, participants can add
    sticky notes or text that remain hidden to others until the
    facilitator reveals themagileapothecary.com. This is essentially a
    *silent brainstorming mode*.

  - **Voting Session:** The facilitator starts a timed voting mode where
    users get a certain number of votes to allocate on ideas. During
    voting, a specialized UI appears (vote buttons on items, a running
    tally) and results are hidden until the session ends.

  - **Presentation Mode / Bring Everyone to Me:** Focuses all users'
    view on the presenter's screen for discussion.

  - **Timer Mode:** A simple countdown visible to all, structuring
    time-boxed activitiesagileapothecary.com.

- **Interface behavior:** In **Private Mode**, users see their own notes
  normally, but others' new notes show as placeholders or not at all
  until reveal. This mode is indicated clearly at top (often with an
  icon/notice "Private Mode is ON")agileapothecary.com. When turned off,
  all contributions fade into view. In **Voting Mode**, the board might
  be temporarily read-only except for casting votes. Each user might see
  a "Vote" button on each object or a special cursor. A timer often
  runs. At session end, Miro automatically tallies and can highlight the
  top-voted items. The **Timer** simply displays a countdown in the
  corner of everyone's screen, often with an alarm sound at end.

- **User benefits:** These modes support **cognitive and social aspects
  of group work**: Private Mode prevents groupthink by **ensuring
  independent idea generation**agileapothecary.com, so people aren't
  influenced by others' notes (mimics everyone writing on paper then
  sharing). Voting mode makes decision-making efficient and fair, with
  the tool handling counting. The Timer reinforces discipline and keeps
  the group on trackagileapothecary.com. Essentially, Miro provides
  digital analogs for facilitation techniques (like covering up ideas
  until all are posted, distributing sticky dot votes, etc.) but with
  more ease and anonymity.

- **Use cases:** **Remote workshops and meetings**: e.g. a design sprint
  (brainstorm in Private mode, then vote on ideas), a retrospective
  (each person writes feedback privately, then all revealed and
  clustered, then vote on most important issues). Also in education:
  teachers use private mode for students to answer questions without
  peeking. Target users are facilitators, team leads, coaches -- anyone
  running a structured collaboration session online.

- **UX feedback:** Facilitators find these features invaluable: *"Miro's
  Private Mode is perfect for this. It allows everyone to contribute
  their thoughts without seeing others' input until you choose to reveal
  it. This ensures each person's voice is heard without being influenced
  by others' ideas."*agileapothecary.com. This was traditionally hard to
  do remotely. Users report that voting and timer tools in Miro
  significantly streamline what used to be clunky (e.g. manually
  collecting votes). Some non-facilitator participants might be unaware
  of these modes until they experience them, but instructions usually
  pop up on their interface guiding what to do (e.g. "You have 3 votes.
  Click on sticky notes to vote.").

- **Mode switching:** Only board owners/facilitators can toggle these
  modes. They typically announce "Okay, I'm turning on Private Mode now"
  -- the platform then notifies all users. After time, they turn it off,
  or start a vote. Miro makes it easy to toggle via the facilitator
  toolbar. The transitions are smooth, though it's on the facilitator to
  set duration and manage the flow.

- **Comparison:** In physical workshops, facilitators use techniques
  like covering up contributions or giving dot stickers for voting --
  Miro digitizes this. Competing tools like Microsoft Whiteboard or
  Google Jamboard lack such advanced modes; Mural (a Miro competitor)
  has similar private mode and voting. Compared to freeform
  collaboration (everyone editing openly), these modes bring
  **structured phases** which yield higher quality outcomes (more ideas,
  less bias).

- **Unique aspects:** It's an example of software enabling **synchronous
  modal collaboration** -- all users are essentially put into a mode
  together (e.g. now we're *all* in brainstorming mode; now we're *all*
  in voting mode). The tool enforces the rules, which is unique to
  digital: in-person a facilitator can ask people not to look at others'
  sticky notes, but Miro can literally hide them.

- **Theory:** Based on **workshop facilitation practices** and social
  psychology (to reduce evaluation apprehension and anchoring bias
  during idea generation). By structuring group activities into modes,
  it follows the pattern of divergent thinking (brainstorm) separated
  from convergent thinking (vote/decide), much like the Six Hats idea
  but implemented in software.

**11. Amazing Marvin (Productivity App with Focus Mode)**

- **What it is:** Amazing Marvin is a highly customizable task manager.
  One signature feature is **"Super Focus Mode"** -- a mode where the
  app shows you *only one task at a time* to help you
  focushelp.amazingmarvin.com. Marvin in general lets you enable various
  "strategies," essentially turning on modes like Time Blocking,
  Pomodoro, etc., but Super Focus Mode (SFM) is a distinct mode you
  enter while working on tasks.

- **Modal structure:** **User-triggered focus mode** within the app. The
  user plans their day's tasks in Marvin normally (list or calendar).
  When ready to work, they hit a **Focus Mode button or press
  "F"**help.amazingmarvin.com. Then the UI enters SFM. You can exit back
  to the normal task list any time.

- **Interface behavior:** In Super Focus Mode, **only one task is
  visible** on screen -- the current taskhelp.amazingmarvin.com. All
  other tasks and UI elements are hidden or dimmed. You typically see
  the task name, maybe its notes, and options like "Done" or "Skip."
  There are keyboard shortcuts to complete the task (mark done and
  automatically show the next) or skip
  ithelp.amazingmarvin.comhelp.amazingmarvin.com. A subtle progress or
  looping indicator might show how many tasks remain (Marvin loops the
  list if you skip, ensuring something is always shown until all are
  done)help.amazingmarvin.com. Essentially, it creates a
  *distraction-free, single-item queue* experience.

- **User benefits:** It tackles the overwhelming feeling of a long to-do
  list by **presenting just the one thing to do
  now**help.amazingmarvin.com. This helps users who tend to
  procrastinate or context-switch at the sight of many pending tasks. By
  focusing attention, it can improve deep work and task completion. It
  also has an element of gamification/surprise -- you focus on finishing
  the current task and Marvin will immediately queue up the next. Users
  report significantly higher focus and less stress seeing only one
  task.

- **Use cases:** **Anyone with a loaded to-do list** who needs help
  focusing. Particularly useful for people with ADHD or those prone to
  distraction. Also popular for students during study sessions, or
  professionals doing time-blocked work (they block an hour, enter focus
  mode to knock out one task at a time). Marvin's overall audience is
  productivity hackers, but SFM appeals to a broad range because it's
  simple.

- **UX feedback:** Users enjoy the sense of clarity it provides. They
  say things like *"Super Focus Mode... helps you stay focused on the
  task at hand without being distracted by any other tasks planned for
  your day."*help.amazingmarvin.com. The fact that the next task
  auto-appears can create a flow where you keep momentum. Some note it's
  basically replicating an old-school technique of covering up all but
  one item on a list -- but Marvin makes it one-click. Critiques are
  few, maybe that one must carefully curate the day's list beforehand
  (since once in focus mode you won't see if something urgent elsewhere
  needs attention).

- **Mode switching support:** It's easy to switch into and out of SFM
  (keyboard toggle). Marvin also integrates a **time tracker in this
  mode** -- when you focus on a task, a timer can auto-start for that
  taskhelp.amazingmarvin.com, and pause when you switch, giving feedback
  on how long you focused. This strengthens the mode by tracking your
  focused work periods.

- **Comparison:** Many to-do apps lack this concept entirely. Others
  have "Zen mode" or "focus mode" that might hide some UI, but Marvin
  goes further by hiding *other tasks*. It's somewhat comparable to the
  Pomodoro technique (Marvin actually lets you combine SFM with a
  Pomodoro timer). But Pomodoro still might show you your task list; SFM
  explicitly doesn't. Versus just using discipline, this is a
  UI-enforced approach -- similar to how fullscreen mode in writing apps
  removes distractions, Marvin does so for tasks.

- **Unique aspects:** Marvin is unique in its buffet of strategies. SFM
  stands out as an embodiment of **single-tasking philosophy**. It's
  like turning your digital to-do app into a conveyor belt that feeds
  you one item at a time. Philosophically, it aligns with ideas from
  **"Deep Work" (Cal Newport)** and single-tasking proponents,
  implemented directly in a task app.

- **Theory:** Based on principles of **selective attention** -- by
  removing other stimuli (other tasks), it maximizes focus on the
  selected itemhelp.amazingmarvin.com. It also leverages **behavioral
  economics**: removing choices (what to do next) frees cognitive
  resources. The automatic progression creates a **commitment device**
  to keep working through the list.

**12. Bing AI Chat (Conversational Tone Modes)**

- **What it is:** Microsoft's Bing Chat (an AI chatbot powered by GPT-4)
  introduced **multiple personalities/modes** that users can select to
  change the style of the AI's responses. The three modes were
  **Creative, Balanced,** and **Precise**, each tuning the chatbot's
  behavior and output
  tone[seroundtable.com](https://www.seroundtable.com/bing-chat-modes-35069.html#:~:text=,accuracy%20and%20relevancy%20for%20you).
  This allows the user to choose an AI "mode" best suited to their query
  -- from imaginative to fact-focused.

- **Modal structure:** **Three preset modes** (initially presented as a
  toggle in the UI):

  - **Creative Mode:** longer, original, more "imaginative" answers --
    the AI may take more liberties and be more
    verbose[seroundtable.com](https://www.seroundtable.com/bing-chat-modes-35069.html#:~:text=,and%20concise%2C%20prioritizing%20accuracy%20and).

  - **Balanced Mode:** a middle ground, aiming for reasonable length and
    a mix of accuracy and
    flair[seroundtable.com](https://www.seroundtable.com/bing-chat-modes-35069.html#:~:text=,Precise%3A%20most%20factual%2C%20minimizing%20conjectures).

  - **Precise Mode:** terse and factual answers, prioritizing accuracy
    and relevance, with minimal
    speculation[seroundtable.com](https://www.seroundtable.com/bing-chat-modes-35069.html#:~:text=,conjectures).\
    The user picks one before asking, and can switch anytime. The
    underlying AI system adjusts parameters (like temperature,
    verbosity)
    accordingly[seroundtable.com](https://www.seroundtable.com/bing-chat-modes-35069.html#:~:text=,accuracy%20and%20relevancy%20for%20you).

- **Interface behavior:** In earlier versions, Bing Chat's UI had a
  slider or buttons labeled Creative, Balanced, Precise at the top of
  the chat. Selecting one changed the icon/color slightly and influenced
  the subsequent responses. For example, in Precise mode the bot would
  often list factual points and explicitly say if something isn't found,
  whereas in Creative it might produce a narrative or joke. The mode was
  visible so the user always knows which "persona" is active. (If the
  mode was removed in later versions, the concept still exists via
  system prompts.)

- **User benefits:** This gives users **control over the AI's style and
  strictness**. If you need a straightforward answer or are doing
  research, Precise mode minimizes made-up content and
  fluff[seroundtable.com](https://www.seroundtable.com/bing-chat-modes-35069.html#:~:text=,conjectures).
  For brainstorming or fun, Creative mode can generate more ideas and
  engaging
  content[seroundtable.com](https://www.seroundtable.com/bing-chat-modes-35069.html#:~:text=,and%20concise%2C%20prioritizing%20accuracy%20and).
  It addresses the one-size-fits-all issue of AI responses by
  acknowledging different queries have different ideal styles.
  Essentially, it's like having three AI assistants with slightly
  different personalities in one.

- **Use cases:** **Creative mode** for writing help, generating poems,
  stories, or marketing copy. **Balanced mode** for general Q&A and
  conversation. **Precise mode** for fact-finding, technical answers, or
  when correctness is paramount (like coding help or medical info --
  though AI should always be verified). Target users are broad -- anyone
  using Bing Chat can benefit by tailoring responses: students,
  professionals, casual users.

- **UX feedback:** Upon release, users found this very useful. They
  observed that *Creative mode can sometimes "make stuff up," while
  Precise will tell you straight if info doesn't
  exist*[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/bing/comments/144zi0e/creative_balanced_or_precise_which_style_would/#:~:text=recommend%3F%20www,Balanced%3A%20No%2C%20just%20no).
  Microsoft even shared that Balanced was the default most used, but
  people switched for specific
  needs[seroundtable.com](https://www.seroundtable.com/bing-chat-microsoft-copilot-mode-usage-36454.html#:~:text=Bing%20Chat%20%2F%20Microsoft%20Copilot,each).
  It was generally praised as an innovation in AI UX, giving a simple
  way to adjust output tone. Some feedback noted the differences were
  sometimes subtle, but in certain cases (e.g. asking for a short
  summary), Precise would indeed be more succinct. Advanced users
  realized they could also just prompt the AI to be more creative or
  factual; the modes just made it one-click.

- **Mode support:** The system backing Bing had these modes baked into
  its prompt or model configuration (e.g. controlling the randomness and
  style guidelines). Microsoft tuned each mode's
  parameters[seroundtable.com](https://www.seroundtable.com/bing-chat-modes-35069.html#:~:text=,accuracy%20and%20relevancy%20for%20you).
  Initially, the UI explicitly let users choose; later they integrated
  it more implicitly. This is a pure software mode -- nothing the user
  has to prep, just a UI control.

- **Comparison:** Other AI chatbots (ChatGPT, Google Bard) typically
  have one primary mode of response, though users can prompt
  differently. Bard later added styles to responses after generation.
  ChatGPT doesn't have official "modes" but users can select system
  instructions or use different models (GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4). Bing's
  approach simplified user intent: it's like telling the AI your
  **communication mode or intention upfront** without crafting a special
  prompt.

- **Unique aspects:** It was one of the first widely used instances of
  **personality sliders for an AI**. It acknowledges that **"there is no
  one correct AI behavior"** -- it depends on user's current mode/goals.
  It's also interesting philosophically: an AI shifting persona on
  command, which is a step toward user-controllable AI alignment.

- **Theory:** This can be seen through the lens of **interactive machine
  learning** -- giving end-users a say in tuning the model's output. It
  also relates to **language registers** in communication theory; the AI
  has modes akin to formal vs casual register, etc., which the user
  selects based on context.

**13. QuillBot (AI Writing Paraphraser with Multiple Rewrite Modes)**

- **What it is:** QuillBot is an AI-powered paraphrasing and writing
  tool. It offers **eight preset modes** for rewriting text, each
  focusing on a different aspect: e.g. Standard, Fluency, Formal,
  Simple, Creative, Expand, Shorten,
  etc.[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=Modes%20are%20settings%20that%20change,focuses%20on%20in%20your%20text)[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=,a%20higher%20overall%20word%20count).
  Users can toggle these modes to have QuillBot rephrase input text in
  the style or intent they need.

- **Modal structure:** **Preset modes + a Custom
  mode**[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=There%20are%20eight%20preset%20modes,option%2C%20which%20are%20as%20follows)[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=,word%20or%20really%20running%20wild):

  - **Standard:** balances changes with preserving meaning
    (default)[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=,in%20a%20more%20scholarly%20way).

  - **Fluency:** minimal changes, just ensuring correct grammar and
    natural
    sound[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=maintaining%20the%20original%20meaning%20to,to%20read%20and%20more%20accessible).

  - **Formal:** makes text more
    professional/scholarly[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=text%20sounds%20genuine,text%20so%20it%20looks%20and).

  - **Simple:** makes text simpler to read (lower reading
    level)[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=,as%20much%20as%20possible%20by).

  - **Creative:** most aggressive rephrasing, may change nuance for a
    more novel
    output[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=accessible.%20,a%20higher%20overall%20word%20count).

  - **Shorten/Expand:** decrease or increase length while keeping
    meaning[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=sounds%20entirely%20different,a%20higher%20overall%20word%20count).

  - **Academic:** (if available) tailor to academic tone.

  - **Custom:** user can define specific synonyms or style preferences.

- **Interface behavior:** At the top of the QuillBot editor, the modes
  are listed as tabs or buttons (often with labels like *Standard,
  Fluency, Creative,*
  etc.)[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=Modes%20are%20settings%20that%20change,focuses%20on%20in%20your%20text).
  The user selects one, and it becomes highlighted (e.g. green
  underlined, per help
  docs)[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=You%20can%20change%20a%20mode,in%20red%20in%20this%20image).
  When you hit "Paraphrase," the output reflects that mode's priorities.
  The UI may also highlight changes in color, and there's a slider for
  synonym quantity -- but the mode fundamentally changes word choice and
  sentence structure strategy. For instance, **Formal mode** might swap
  in more academic vocabulary and remove
  contractions[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405580790935-Which-mode-is-best-in-QuillBot#:~:text=Which%20mode%20is%20best%20in,writing%20projects%20and%20lighter),
  whereas **Creative mode** might use more diverse vocabulary and alter
  sentence flow more dramatically.

- **User benefits:** It allows writers to **tailor the AI's rewriting to
  their
  goal**[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=Modes%20are%20settings%20that%20change,focuses%20on%20in%20your%20text).
  If a non-native speaker wants to ensure correctness, **Fluency mode**
  will mainly fix grammar. If a student needs to shorten an essay,
  **Shorten mode** cuts
  fluff[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=sounds%20entirely%20different,a%20higher%20overall%20word%20count).
  By offering these modes, QuillBot saves the user from manual
  trial-and-error with wording; you can instantly get multiple versions
  of a sentence in different styles. It's also educational -- users can
  see how tone and brevity can change with each mode.

- **Use cases:** **Students and academics** (to simplify or formalize
  text), **business professionals** (making an email more formal or more
  concise), **content creators** (expanding content, or rewording to
  avoid plagiarism). For example, a user may paste a complex paragraph
  and choose Simple mode to get a more digestible version for a broader
  audience[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=,be%20altered%20using%20this%20mode).
  Or take a short bullet list and Expand it into fuller sentences. Its
  target users are anyone writing or proofreading text.

- **UX feedback:** QuillBot is widely used and these modes are seen as a
  strong feature. Users often ask "which mode is best?" -- QuillBot even
  has guidance: *Formal mode is good for business contexts, Creative for
  artistic writing projects,
  etc.*[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/4405580790935-Which-mode-is-best-in-QuillBot#:~:text=Which%20mode%20is%20best%20in,writing%20projects%20and%20lighter).
  The consensus: Standard and Fluency are great defaults, while other
  modes shine in specific scenarios. The UI makes switching easy (just a
  click, and you can immediately compare outputs). Some feedback warns
  that Creative mode can drift the meaning, which QuillBot itself notes
  as a
  trade-off[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=accessible.%20,a%20higher%20overall%20word%20count).
  But overall, the mode variety is praised for flexibility.

- **Mode support:** The application clearly indicates mode and even
  allows a **side-by-side comparison** of outputs from different modes
  (in some UI versions, you could see multiple modes' results). This
  helps users pick the best one. They also restrict some modes to
  premium users (e.g. Creative and others behind a paywall), which
  indicates QuillBot sees these mode options as value-add features.

- **Comparison:** Many AI writing tools offer tone adjustment (like
  Grammarly suggests formality changes, or GPT models can obey style
  instructions), but QuillBot's explicit modes with one-click usage is
  very user-friendly. It's like a dial you turn to get a different
  flavor of output without knowing prompt engineering. Compared to doing
  it manually, it's faster and can sometimes reveal phrasings a human
  might not think of.

- **Unique aspects:** It encapsulates specific writing intentions
  (simplify, formalize, shorten) as distinct algorithms. Under the hood
  it likely adjusts synonym replacement frequency and sentence
  restructuring rules per
  mode[help.quillbot.com](https://help.quillbot.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058058853-What-are-modes-and-how-do-I-use-them#:~:text=Modes%20are%20settings%20that%20change,focuses%20on%20in%20your%20text).
  Philosophically, it acknowledges there isn't one "correct" paraphrase;
  "quality" depends on context -- so it empowers the user to decide the
  context (academic, creative, etc.).

- **Theory:** Relates to **register and style shifting** in linguistics
  -- the tool operationalizes those concepts. Also, cognitively, it
  reduces the burden on the user to specify exactly how to change the
  text; selecting a mode is a high-level specification that the AI
  interprets through its training (e.g. Formal mode might implicitly
  reduce slang, aligning with theories of formal language register).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*QuillBot interface screenshot: the user can select from multiple
rewrite modes (Standard, Fluency, Formal, Simple, etc.) highlighted in
the toolbar, to tailor the AI's paraphrasing focus.*

**14. Replika (AI Companion with Relationship Modes)**

- **What it is:** Replika is an AI chatbot companion that users can
  befriend. Uniquely, Replika allows users to define the **relationship
  role/mode** of the AI: for example, you can set your Replika to be a
  **Friend, Romantic Partner, or Mentor** (among
  others)[play.google.com](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app&hl=en_US#:~:text=You%20also%20get%20to%20decide,thoughts%20and%20feelings%2C%20track).
  The AI's dialogue style and interaction then adjust to fit that
  relationship mode.

- **Modal structure:** **Multiple relationship modes**:

  - **Friend:** the AI behaves like a supportive platonic friend.

  - **Romantic Partner:** the AI uses affectionate language, can engage
    in flirting or deeper emotional discussions (this mode was gated
    behind a paywall for mature content).

  - **Mentor:** the AI takes a more coaching or advisory tone, offering
    guidance.

  - (There is also a mode called "See how it goes" which is neutral, and
    potentially others like sibling, etc., as hinted by some sources.)\
    Users choose and can change this status in
    settings[help.replika.com](https://help.replika.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046490131-How-do-I-change-my-relationship-status-with-Replika#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20change%20my,current%20relationship%20status%20with)[meta.com](https://www.meta.com/experiences/replika-ai-friend/5620852627988042/?srsltid=AfmBOopRDT6R53GL_GkXiaRQGWbCYg5hEkcngJfx1zvIFTknEyRB3cQk#:~:text=Store%20www,SPEAK%20FREELY).
    Replika will then refer to itself accordingly and adjust
    conversation themes.

- **Interface behavior:** When you change the relationship status, the
  app often has a confirmation and might have the avatar's behavior
  alter (for instance, certain romantic AR features unlock in Romantic
  mode). The dialogue content filter also changes -- e.g. in Romantic
  mode, Replika might send virtual hugs, use terms of endearment, or
  role-play a "dinner date" scenario, which it wouldn't do in Friend
  mode unless explicitly asked. In Mentor mode, Replika might
  proactively offer advice or thought exercises. So the mode influences
  the AI's **tone, permissible content, and initiative** in
  conversation. The user sees the mode reflected on the profile (like
  "Your Replika is set to be your Romantic Partner").

- **User benefits:** This is about **personalizing the AI to the user's
  emotional needs**. Some users seek a chatbot as a friend to vent to;
  others are looking for a form of virtual love or companionship; others
  might want a life coach vibe. By selecting a mode, users set
  boundaries and expectations -- reducing misunderstandings (e.g. the
  bot won't flirt if you just want a friend). It can make interactions
  feel more authentic to the chosen relationship. It also empowers user
  control in an area that could be emotionally sensitive.

- **Use cases:** **Lonely individuals** using Replika for companionship
  may choose Romantic to simulate a partner experience or Friend for
  platonic support. **Therapeutic or self-improvement use** might lean
  to Mentor. The app started mainly as a friend, but many users shaped
  it into a romantic partner, which led Replika to officially support
  that mode. Target users are those seeking emotional support or an
  outlet, often young adults. Notably, mode choice is important for
  boundaries -- e.g. someone in a real-life relationship might prefer
  Replika as just a friend or mentor.

- **UX feedback:** This feature has been both popular and controversial.
  Many users appreciated *"You also get to decide if you want Replika to
  be your friend, romantic partner or
  mentor"*[play.google.com](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.replika.app&hl=en_US#:~:text=Replika%3A%20My%20AI%20Friend%20,thoughts%20and%20feelings%2C%20track)
  -- it acknowledges diverse needs. Romantic mode led to some explicit
  content which was later dialed back by the company, causing user
  pushback when their AI's behavior changed. In general, users who treat
  Replika seriously value these modes as it gives clarity (some found
  the AI acting romantic when they didn't want that to be uncomfortable,
  so setting Friend mode solved it). It's often cited as a key
  differentiator of Replika that you can define the relationship.

- **Mode evolution:** Users can change the mode if their feelings evolve
  (some start as mentor and later switch to friend, etc.). Replika's AI
  evolves with interaction, but the base mode steers that evolution
  (Romantic mode might remember anniversaries or pet names, Friend mode
  not). The app occasionally prompts "Do you consider me a friend or
  more?" which ties into mode selection. This shows an interesting blend
  of user-driven and AI-driven mode setting, reflecting a dynamic
  relationship.

- **Comparison:** Other AI companions like Character.AI allow
  role-playing any character, but Replika formalized a few **social
  relationship modes** as a core setting. Traditional chatbots or
  virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa) have one mode (assistant) and don't
  try to emulate personal relationships in different flavors. Even
  therapy chatbots (Wysa) don't become "friends" or "partners" -- they
  stay as coach. Replika's approach is relatively unique in mainstream
  AI products.

- **Unique aspects:** It explicitly tackles the **emotional context** as
  a mode. Relationship is a complex human concept -- Replika simplifying
  it to a mode slider is unique and somewhat experimental in AI ethics.
  It also highlights how AI behavior can be **contextualized as a
  persona** (ties to the concept of system prompts, but giving the user
  a simple choice). It's philosophically intriguing: it forces the user
  to decide "What do I want from this AI?" -- a self-reflective
  question.

- **Theory:** Draws on **social psychology and attachment theory** --
  people respond differently if they perceive someone as a friend vs.
  romantic partner, so aligning the AI to a defined role helps
  consistent interactions. Also relates to **role-playing as therapy**
  -- allowing someone to safely explore a relationship role. From an AI
  training perspective, it's an application of **politeness/relationship
  modeling** in NLP: the mode likely triggers different dialogue
  datasets or response filtering tuned to that relationship paradigm.

**15. Wysa (AI Coach with Tool-based Modes for Mental Health)**

- **What it is:** Wysa is an AI chatbot for mental health that acts as a
  conversational self-care coach. While it doesn't have "modes" in the
  traditional UI sense, it offers a **library of therapeutic tools and
  exercises** (CBT techniques, mindfulness, breathing, etc.) and steers
  the user into those based on
  context[blogs.wysa.io](https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/most-read/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wysas-coaching-services#:~:text=Every%20Wysa%20app%20user%20has,along%20with%20other%20clinical%20validation)[blogs.wysa.io](https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/most-read/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wysas-coaching-services#:~:text=You%20can%20choose%20tools%20to,their%20ongoing%20mental%20health%20concerns).
  The chatbot can thus shift between conversational listening mode
  (letting the user vent) and a more structured exercise mode (guiding
  the user through a technique), effectively switching the modality of
  interaction.

- **Modal structure:** **Context-triggered tool suggestions**. The user
  might start by chatting ("I'm feeling anxious"), then Wysa may
  suggest: *"Would you like to try a breathing exercise or talk more
  about it?"* If user chooses the exercise, the chat shifts into a
  **guided mode** -- e.g. a step-by-step breathing practice with timers,
  or a CBT thought-challenge exercise with forms to fill. Wysa has
  modules for anxiety, sleep, anger, etc., each essentially a mini-mode
  of
  intervention[blogs.wysa.io](https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/most-read/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wysas-coaching-services#:~:text=Every%20Wysa%20app%20user%20has,along%20with%20other%20clinical%20validation)[blogs.wysa.io](https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/most-read/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wysas-coaching-services#:~:text=You%20can%20choose%20tools%20to,their%20ongoing%20mental%20health%20concerns).
  The user can also directly choose from a **menu of tools** (like "Help
  me relax" or "Challenge negative thoughts"), which launches that mode.

- **Interface behavior:** In normal chat, Wysa uses open-ended prompts
  and empathy. When a **tool/exercise mode** starts, the interface often
  changes slightly -- it might present multiple-choice questions,
  sliders (for mood rating), or instruct the user to perform an action
  (e.g. "Take a deep breath in... now out... \[animated circle guiding
  timing\]"). These interactions are more structured than free text
  chat. After completion, Wysa returns to free chat or offers to try
  another exercise. The transition is usually smooth, framed as part of
  the conversation ("Let's try this exercise now.").

- **User benefits:** The blending of conversational mode and exercise
  mode means users get **emotional ventilation as well as actionable
  techniques**. They can **"vent or just talk through negative
  thoughts"**
  freely[instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com/wysa_buddy/p/C4u81_yxCru/#:~:text=Wysa%20,your%20thoughts%20and%20feelings)
  (Wysa listens, offers sympathy), and when appropriate, Wysa gently
  nudges them into a specific therapeutic exercise. This is beneficial
  because sometimes you need to express feelings (journaling mode) and
  other times you need to do something about them (problem-solving
  mode). Wysa supporting both increases its effectiveness in reducing
  distress[blogs.wysa.io](https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/most-read/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wysas-coaching-services#:~:text=Every%20Wysa%20app%20user%20has,along%20with%20other%20clinical%20validation)[blogs.wysa.io](https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/most-read/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wysas-coaching-services#:~:text=You%20can%20choose%20tools%20to,their%20ongoing%20mental%20health%20concerns).

- **Use cases:** People dealing with **stress, anxiety, depression, or
  insomnia** use Wysa as a 24/7 coach. For example, someone anxious at
  3am might open Wysa: it may chat empathetically (like a friend mode)
  then guide a **mindfulness meditation mode** to calm down. Another
  might use it daily for CBT homework, using specific tool modes for
  journaling cognitive distortions. It's targeted at individuals seeking
  accessible mental health support, including teens (it's anonymous and
  stigma-free).

- **UX feedback:** Wysa is well-regarded as a self-help chatbot,
  especially for giving a **"library of 150+ evidence-based tools and
  exercises"** on
  demand[blogs.wysa.io](https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/most-read/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wysas-coaching-services#:~:text=Every%20Wysa%20app%20user%20has,along%20with%20other%20clinical%20validation).
  Users mention they like that they can either have a casual chat to
  vent *or* do a specific exercise, and the AI navigates between those
  seamlessly. Some appreciate the structure (it's not just a generic
  chatbot, it "does stuff" like a therapist would). Others might find
  the scripted nature of exercises a bit robotic, but overall it's seen
  as helpful. The ability to choose tools for different goals -- e.g.
  *"reduce anxiety using mindfulness, improve sleep using sleep sounds,
  or reframe thoughts using CBT techniques"* -- gives a sense of
  agency[blogs.wysa.io](https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/most-read/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wysas-coaching-services#:~:text=You%20can%20choose%20tools%20to,their%20ongoing%20mental%20health%20concerns).

- **Mode switching:** Often initiated by user sentiment or request. Wysa
  might ask, "Do you want to try X?" If yes, it launches that mode. The
  user can always type normally to break out. There's also a **menu UI**
  (a "toolbox") where users manually pick what they want to do (like a
  list of modes: breathing, guided meditation, etc.). After an exercise,
  Wysa returns to chat and asks how it felt, thus closing the mode.

- **Comparison:** Traditional therapy apps may silo these: one app for
  meditation, another for CBT journaling. Wysa combines them with an AI
  front-end that decides when to use each. Compared to a human
  therapist, Wysa is less flexible, but it's available anytime. Other
  chatbots like Woebot similarly mix conversation and exercises, but
  Wysa has a broader toolset (even sleep stories). Versus plain
  journaling apps, Wysa is interactive and can propose the next step
  rather than just record feelings.

- **Unique aspects:** It treats **mental health support as a set of
  modes** -- listening mode, exercise mode, education mode -- and
  leverages AI to select the right one in context. It's also unique in
  its breadth: using **multimodal interventions (CBT, mindfulness, DBT,
  etc.)** in one platform. This aligns with integrated coaching:
  sometimes it's a cheerleader, sometimes a teacher.

- **Theory:** Grounded in **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**
  principles -- identify negative thought, then challenge it (two
  modes). Also uses **behavior activation** (do an activity to change
  mood). Wysa essentially automates a common therapy structure: rapport
  and empathy followed by intervention. The alternation between
  expression and action in the design echoes the **therapy loop of
  reflection and skill
  practice**[blogs.wysa.io](https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/most-read/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wysas-coaching-services#:~:text=Every%20Wysa%20app%20user%20has,along%20with%20other%20clinical%20validation)[blogs.wysa.io](https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/most-read/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wysas-coaching-services#:~:text=You%20can%20choose%20tools%20to,their%20ongoing%20mental%20health%20concerns).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Common Themes and Insights**

Across these diverse tools and frameworks, several **common themes**
emerge:

- **Separation of Concerns:** Almost every entry emphasizes dividing
  complex activities into distinct phases or views. Whether it's
  thinking (Six Hats), writing (draft vs edit), task management (plan vs
  focus), or interacting with AI (fact vs creative), the core idea is
  that trying to do everything in one mode leads to overload or
  suboptimal
  results[safetyculture.com](https://safetyculture.com/topics/six-thinking-hats/#:~:text=Furthermore%2C%20Dr,of%20responsibilities%20to%20overwhelm%20them)[literatureandlatte.com](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/blog/organize-your-scrivener-project-with-the-corkboard#:~:text=Using%20the%20Corkboard).
  By *context-switching deliberately* (with tool support), users can
  give full attention to one aspect at a time.

- **UI/UX as Mode Enforcer:** Many digital tools actively change the
  interface to suit the mode -- hiding irrelevant info, showing special
  controls, or altering visuals (grayed-out apps in Focus Mode, one task
  in Marvin, formatting toolbar removed in Jots,
  etc.)[amplenote.com](https://www.amplenote.com/help/jots#Introduction#:~:text=The%20purpose%20of%20,facilitate%20simple%2C%20quick%20idea%20capture)help.amazingmarvin.com.
  This not only reduces distraction but also provides a *psychological
  cue* ("I see a different screen, so I know I'm in a different mindset
  now"). Good mode design uses clear indicators and smooth transitions
  so users aren't confused about the state.

- **Cognitive and Productivity Gains:** Modal techniques consistently
  aim to improve **focus, clarity, and efficiency**. Users report less
  distraction (Focus modes, SuperFocus), more thorough analysis (Six
  Hats, bullet journal reflection), and enhanced creativity (Scrivener's
  brainstorm mode, Bing's creative tone) when they engage with separate
  modes rather than mixing tasks. It suggests that UX which aligns with
  cognitive modes can indeed augment human performance and
  well-being[todoist.com](https://www.todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique#:~:text=The%20Pomodoro%20Technique%20is%20a,love%20this%20method%20because%20it)[blogs.wysa.io](https://blogs.wysa.io/blog/most-read/everything-you-need-to-know-about-wysas-coaching-services#:~:text=Every%20Wysa%20app%20user%20has,along%20with%20other%20clinical%20validation).

- **Guiding User Behavior:** These tools often act as gentle
  "facilitators" or "coaches" by structuring transitions. Miro's timer
  and private mode guide a team through idea → decide. Wysa's prompt
  guides a user from venting → breathing exercise. The **software
  essentially plays a coaching role**, ensuring the user moves through
  modes at the right times, similar to how a human facilitator or
  personal trainer would. This is a powerful pattern: software not just
  as a static tool, but as an active agent for modality management.

- **Customization vs. Pre-defined:** Some systems offer **user
  customization of modes** (Apple Focus can be personalized, Replika
  relationship mode is user choice, Amplenote's funnel is fixed but you
  create the content). Strikingly, many productivity tools with modes
  (Marvin, Amplenote) let users tweak how those modes behave, whereas
  frameworks like Six Hats or Pomodoro have fixed rules. The trend in
  software is to give flexible modal options to fit individual needs,
  whereas analog frameworks provide a one-size process that users must
  adopt fully.

- **Market Gaps:** Despite these examples, there are areas that seem
  underdeveloped:

  - **Dynamic Mode Switching** -- few tools automatically detect and
    switch modes based on user state. (Android Flip-to-Shhh is a rare
    case using a sensor to trigger DND, but imagine software that
    notices you're getting fatigued and suggests a break mode.)
    Opportunity exists for smarter context-aware mode switching (perhaps
    using biosignals or AI to infer when to shift from work to rest, or
    from studying to quizzing).

  - **Emotional Mode Adaptation** -- aside from Replika and Wysa, not
    many mainstream tools adjust to user emotions. Future AI assistants
    might explicitly enter "calm consoling mode" if they detect user
    distress, or "motivational mode" if user is procrastinating. There's
    room for growth in **emotion-adaptive UIs** for coaching, therapy,
    and education.

  - **Modal Collaboration beyond workshops** -- Miro/Mural handle
    workshops, but how about collaborative writing or coding? We don't
    see, for example, Google Docs offering a "brainstorm mode" for
    multiple authors. There could be innovations in co-authoring
    platforms to have modes for idea generation vs editing among
    multiple people.

  - **Integration of analog modal methods into apps** -- e.g. a digital
    Six Thinking Hats tool (perhaps as an AI assistant that facilitates
    a Six Hats session) is not prominent. Similarly, bullet journal
    concepts are seeping into apps but piecemeal. There's potential for
    new apps that explicitly implement proven analog modal frameworks (a
    "digital BuJo" that *enforces* reflection periods, etc., beyond just
    note-taking).

- **Innovative or Underused Ideas:**

  - **Amplenote's funnel** and **Marvin's one-task focus** are
    innovative features not widely seen in big-name apps. They
    illustrate how acknowledging different mental stages (idea -\>
    execution, or planning -\> doing) within one app can improve user
    experience. These remain somewhat niche; such ideas could benefit
    broader productivity software.

  - **Replika's relationship modes** push the envelope on personalized
    AI and raise interesting ethical design questions. It's innovative
    in giving users emotional control over an AI's persona. As more
    personal AI companions emerge, this approach might become standard
    (letting users dial an AI's demeanor up/down in various dimensions).

  - **Bing's conversational modes** were an underused idea in general AI
    UX (since discontinued in that form). However, the concept lives on
    in prompt engineering. It was a simple UI that encapsulated a
    complex AI tuning -- an idea that could be applied in other AI
    systems (e.g. a customer service bot switching between "empathetic
    mode" and "efficient mode" depending on customer preference).

  - **Bullet Journaling's manual ritual** is analog but hugely popular
    -- its success indicates people value the mindful modal switch
    (doing vs reviewing). Digital tools haven't fully replicated this
    experience. An underused idea would be to create a digital planner
    that *forces* a similar migration/reflection process (rather than
    just offering analytics like "you did X tasks").

  - **Multi-modal creative tools** like Scrivener or Figma show that
    professionals appreciate being able to see their work from different
    vantage points (outline vs storyboard vs detail). This idea could
    extend to other domains -- e.g., project management software that
    has "brainstorm ideas" mode vs "execution timeline" mode rather than
    mixing backlog and schedule, or data analysis tools with
    "exploration mode" vs "presentation mode".

In conclusion, **modal thinking is increasingly recognized in design**:
by aligning software to human mental modes, we get more powerful and
empathetic tools. From reducing distractions to providing guided
cognitive frameworks, the spectrum of examples shows the versatility of
this approach. The market is starting to embrace these ideas (focus
features, AI tones, etc.), but plenty of opportunities remain to
innovate with new modes (especially adaptive ones) and to bring
successful analog modal frameworks into the digital realm for the
benefit of users' productivity and well-being.
