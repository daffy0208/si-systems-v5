**04-03 Middleware Use Cases**

In BrainFrame, **Middleware** refers to the intelligent layer that
bridges core frameworks (e.g. SelfFrame, Shadow Planner) with external
tools, data sources, or AI models.

It acts as an integrative mesh --- translating between systems,
smoothing friction, and enabling context-aware interaction.

**Core Functions**

1.  **Context Transfer**

    - Carries user state and focus across tools.

    - Example: From journaling app to meeting notes, with intentions
      preserved.

2.  **Dynamic Framing**

    - Applies user-defined lenses (e.g. values, goals, tensions) to raw
      data or tasks.

    - Example: A to-do list re-ordered by alignment, not urgency.

3.  **System Translation**

    - Bridges structured logic (e.g. Notion databases) with fluid
      prompts or reflections.

    - Example: Turn a content calendar into an insight prompt engine.

4.  **Temporal Awareness**

    - Links time-based reflection (weekly reviews, project arcs) to
      daily action.

    - Example: Surface last month's intention during this week's
      planning.

**Use Case Categories**

- **Personal Systems Integration**

  - Connects BrainFrame to user calendars, docs, task managers.

- **Team Alignment Middleware**

  - Shared mental models across collaborators.

- **Adaptive AI Routing**

  - Chooses best AI mode (co-creator, summariser, challenger) based on
    current context.

Middleware is the nervous system of BrainFrame --- invisible, adaptive,
and vital to coherence.

It turns insight into flow.
