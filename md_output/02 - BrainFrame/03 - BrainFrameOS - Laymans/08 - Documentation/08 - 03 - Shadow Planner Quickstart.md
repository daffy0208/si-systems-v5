**08-03 Shadow Planner Quickstart**

The Shadow Planner is your reflective dashboard --- tracking energy,
momentum, tension, and meaning across time.

Unlike task managers, it doesn't focus on what you *did*. It tracks how
you *felt*, what you *learned*, and where your patterns live.

**Daily Flow (Simplified)**

**Morning Prompt:**

- What's your energy like?

- What's your focus word or theme?

- Anything pulling you off-center already?

**Midday Scan (Optional):**

- What's been smooth?

- Where's the friction?

- What wants your attention?

**Evening Reflection:**

- What drained you? What fed you?

- What tension showed up?

- One insight, if any?

**Weekly Flow**

**Sunday Reset Prompts:**

- What were the 3 biggest patterns?

- What repeated?

- What shifted?

- What wants to end, emerge, or evolve?

Use this to:

- Adjust your SelfFrame

- Change priorities

- Let go of unhelpful loops

**Optional Metrics (Choose 1--3 to Track)**

- Energy (1--5)

- Clarity (Foggy → Clear)

- Momentum (Stuck → Flowing)

- Inner Noise (High → Low)

Use the Shadow Planner like a mirror, not a checklist.

**The goal isn't to be perfect --- it's to become aware.**
