**02 - 01 - 01 - Framework Overview**

**Purpose of This Document**

This document introduces the foundational structure that underpins the
BrainFrame system: the Framework. It outlines the key pillars of
personal system architecture --- **Why**, **What**, and **How** --- and
explains how they interact to create clarity, direction, and momentum.

**What Is a Framework?**

A Framework is a structured snapshot of your internal operating system.
It connects your purpose, your roles, and your working style into a
unified reference point. The Framework is the most essential component
of BrainFrame --- everything else builds on this.

It answers:

- **Why** you do what you do (Purpose, values, internal motivation)

- **What** you are here to build or become (Roles, strengths, outcomes)

- **How** you naturally think, work, and grow (Cognitive and behavioural
  style)

**The Three Core Layers**

**1. WHY -- Purpose & Values**

- Your inner mission and the contribution that matters to you

- Core values that drive your motivation and meaning

- The deeper 'why' behind your choices, direction, and energy

**2. WHAT -- Roles & Strengths**

- The unique roles you are here to play in the world

- Your signature strengths, talents, and ways of creating value

- The work, impact, or outputs that feel most meaningful to you

**3. HOW -- Cognitive & Behavioural Style**

- How your mind works (thinking patterns, attention, processing style)

- How you best operate in real life (rhythms, environment, systems)

- Your learning style, growth cycles, and operating preferences

**Why the Framework Matters**

- Without a clear Framework, personal systems tend to drift, feel
  overwhelming, or become disconnected from what matters.

- With a Framework, every tool, planner, prompt, or decision becomes
  easier to align.

- It is not about locking yourself in --- it's about **anchoring
  yourself in clarity** so you can adapt with purpose.

**How This Fits in BrainFrame**

The Framework is the first thing defined in the system because it
informs everything else:

- Your **SelfFrame** is a personal version of this Framework

- The **Shadow Planner** uses your Framework to guide weekly reflection
  and planning

- The **AI Interaction Layer** uses your Framework to adapt ChatGPT to
  your style

- All enhancement tools align back to your Framework to avoid drift

**Next:** Complete the Framework Template in \[02 - 01 - 02 - Framework
Template.docx\] to define your own.

You can revisit and revise your Framework at any point --- but defining
a first version is what activates the rest of the system.
