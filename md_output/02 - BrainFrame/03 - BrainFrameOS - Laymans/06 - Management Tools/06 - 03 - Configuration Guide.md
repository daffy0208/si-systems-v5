**06-03 Configuration Guide**

The Configuration Guide outlines how to set up, customise, and evolve
your BrainFrame environment.

It is both a technical setup reference and a philosophical alignment
tool --- ensuring the system feels like an extension of *you*.

**Step 1: Define Your Primary Mode**

- Personal Growth / Reflection

- Strategy & Systems Thinking

- Team / Org Alignment

- Creative Workflows

This informs tone, templates, and prompt calibration.

**Step 2: Choose Your Core Modules**

Start with 2--3 that resonate:

- Shadow Planner

- SelfFrame

- Prompt Library

- Decision Maps

- AI Companion Setup

- Modular Templates Folder

**Step 3: Set Preferences**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Setting**                  **Example Options**
  ---------------------------- ------------------------------------------
  Tone Calibration             Gentle / Direct / Curious

  Output Format                Bullet / Narrative / Mixed

  Prompt Style                 Open / Framed / Structured

  Reflection Cadence           Daily / Weekly / As needed

  AI Role                      Partner / Mirror / Coach
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Step 4: Add Personal Metadata**

- Your current roles

- Core values

- Working tensions

- Preferred metaphors

This powers Adaptive Prompting and Context Transfer.

**Step 5: Save + Iterate**

- Use the Version Tracker to document changes.

- Update as your context evolves.

- Reflect on how configuration changes affect clarity and energy.

**Reminder:** Configuration is not a setup task. It's a co-evolving
ritual.

Set your BrainFrame to work with you --- not just for you.
