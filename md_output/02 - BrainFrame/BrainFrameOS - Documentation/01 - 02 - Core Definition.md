**01 - 02 - Core Definition**

**Purpose of This Document**

This document clearly defines what BrainFrame is --- and what it isn't.

Many systems are hard to describe because they are overly complex or try
to be everything. BrainFrame is intentionally simple at the core. This
definition creates shared clarity for anyone using or building on the
system.

**What Is BrainFrame?**

BrainFrame is a **personal operating system** --- a modular, human-first
structure for:

- Making sense of your mind and working style

- Creating internal clarity and external alignment

- Supporting purposeful reflection, action, and growth

It is designed to evolve with you --- not control you.

**What BrainFrame Is NOT**

- ❌ A productivity tracker

- ❌ A habit-forming app

- ❌ A fixed set of beliefs or life rules

- ❌ A coaching methodology

Instead, it's a **flexible framework** that:

- Organises your thinking

- Adapts to your rhythm

- Helps you reflect and move forward with clarity

**Key Characteristics**

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Element**            **Description**
  ---------------------- --------------------------------------------------------
  **Human-First**        Built around how people naturally think, reflect, and
                         decide

  **Modular**            Every part is optional --- use what fits, skip what
                         doesn't

  **Self-Framing**       You define your own logic, values, and rhythms --- the
                         system supports that

  **Clarity-Oriented**   The goal is clarity and momentum --- not perfection

  **Tool-Agnostic**      Can be used in any format: notebook, Notion, ChatGPT,
                         pen + paper
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Who It's For**

- Thinkers, builders, leaders, creators

- People who reflect deeply, work intuitively, or think in systems

- Anyone tired of rigid methods and ready to build their own way of
  working

**What Makes It Different**

- It doesn't try to change who you are --- it helps you *use who you
  are*.

- It doesn't tell you what to do --- it helps you *decide how to think*.

- It builds internal stability in a world full of external noise.
