**02 - 05 - 03 - Energy Planner Template**

**Purpose of This Tool**

The Energy Planner helps you map your time and tasks based on
**energy**, not just urgency or importance.

It's designed for people who want to:

- Avoid burnout

- Work with their natural rhythms

- Make space for creative or deep work

**Step 1: Map Your Energy Pattern**

Across a typical day or week:

- When are you most energised?

- When do you need recovery?

- When is your focus naturally strong?

Use this to shape your calendar or flow:

- ðŸŸ¢ High energy blocks â†’ Deep work

- ðŸŸ¡ Medium energy blocks â†’ Admin, meetings

- ðŸ”´ Low energy blocks â†’ Rest, reflection, light tasks

**Step 2: Plan Around Energy**

**Tasks I need to complete:**

- 
- 

**Energy level required:**

- [ ] High (deep work, creative output)

- [ ] Medium (communication, planning)

- [ ] Low (routine, admin, review)

**When will I do it?** *(Match task to energy block)*

**Step 3: Weekly Energy Intentions**

- What do I want to protect this week? (e.g. creative time, rest)

- What drains me that I can reduce or remove?

- How will I support recovery and sustainability?
