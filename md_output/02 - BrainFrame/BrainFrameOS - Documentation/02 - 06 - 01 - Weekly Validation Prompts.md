**02 - 06 - 01 - Weekly Validation Prompts**

**Purpose of This Tool**

These prompts are designed to help you **validate how well your system
is working** --- every week. It's a micro-check-in to:

- Spot drift

- Reinforce alignment

- Refine your rhythms

Use them at the end of each week or as part of your Shadow Planner
reflection.

**Core Weekly Prompts**

- Did I act in alignment with my SelfFrame this week?

- Where did I feel most connected to my Why?

- What actions or habits felt naturally energising?

- What felt like friction or forced effort?

- Did I use my system tools? Why or why not?

**Follow-Up Prompts (Optional)**

- What would I keep the same next week?

- What do I want to approach differently?

- Is there anything I'm avoiding?

- What's one small reset or upgrade I could make now?

**Tip**

Don't overthink your answers. You're not proving anything --- you're
just checking in with yourself.

Sometimes even writing one sentence per prompt is enough to:

- Re-anchor your system

- Prevent slow drift

- Notice what you've already improved

**Next:** Use \[02 - 06 - 02 - Review Log Template.docx\] to track your
weekly validation notes over time.
