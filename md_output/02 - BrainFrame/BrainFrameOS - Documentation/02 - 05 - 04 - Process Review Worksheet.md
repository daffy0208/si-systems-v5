**02 - 05 - 04 - Process Review Worksheet**

**Purpose of This Tool**

This worksheet helps you step back and review how your personal system
is functioning.

It's designed for quarterly reflection --- or anytime you feel unclear,
overwhelmed, or like your system needs a tune-up.

**Step 1: What's Working?**

- What parts of my system feel natural and aligned?

- What tools or rhythms are helping me think clearly and move forward?

- What feedback or results affirm that the system is working?

**Step 2: What's Not Working?**

- Where do I feel friction, fatigue, or avoidance?

- What tools feel like overhead or performance?

- Where am I drifting from my SelfFrame or Framework?

**Step 3: What Needs Updating?**

- Does anything in my Framework need to evolve?

- Do my planner prompts still resonate?

- Has my energy pattern shifted?

- Is AI responding well to how I think now?

**Step 4: Reset or Refine**

- What will I stop doing?

- What will I simplify?

- What will I recommit to?

- What will I test or explore next?

**Tip**

Use this worksheet alongside:

- Drift Detector (02 - 05 - 02)

- Review Log (02 - 06 - 02)

- AI Configuration (02 - 07 - 01)

Doing a process review regularly builds trust in your system and helps
it evolve *with* you --- not drift *away* from you.
