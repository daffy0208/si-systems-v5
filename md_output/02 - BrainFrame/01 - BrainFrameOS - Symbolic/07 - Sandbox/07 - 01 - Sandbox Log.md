**07-01 Sandbox Log**

The Sandbox is BrainFrame's live experimentation zone --- where ideas,
modules, prompts, and prototypes can be tested without risk or
permanence.

The **Sandbox Log** captures what has been tried, what was learned, and
whether anything should be integrated into the core system.

**Log Entry Format**

**What to Log**

- Experimental prompts or modules

- Temporary reconfigurations (e.g. new AI tone)

- Unexpected user behaviours or use cases

- Emergent workflows

**Use Cases**

- Safe space for creative exploration

- Prototype development notes

- Feedback loop with users or team

- Trace unusual insight patterns

**Reflection Prompts**

"What did I learn from this test?"\
"Did it increase or decrease clarity?"\
"Is this ready to share, refine, or archive?"

**Nothing gets lost here. Nothing has to be perfect.**

The Sandbox Log ensures all experiments leave a trail --- even if they
don't make it to release.
