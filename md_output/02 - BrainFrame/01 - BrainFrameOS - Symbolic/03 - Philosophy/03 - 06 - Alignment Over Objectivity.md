**03-06 Alignment Over Objectivity**

Objectivity is often presented as the highest form of truth. But in
BrainFrame, **alignment** is what matters most.

Why?\
Because humans are not machines. We are value-driven, meaning-seeking,
and context-sensitive. Decisions aren't made in vacuums --- they're made
in lived lives.

**The Myth of Objectivity**

- \"Neutral\" systems still embed values --- they just don't name them.

- Pretending to be objective often hides important nuance.

- Attempts at neutrality can create misalignment with what users truly
  need.

**Alignment = Resonance + Integrity**

- Alignment asks: *Does this serve the user's actual goals, values, and
  state?*

- It prioritises:

  - Clarity of intention

  - Consistency of framing

  - Truthfulness to experience

**In Practice**

- AI responses are calibrated to be context-aware, not generic.

- Reflections are shaped by user philosophy, not external metrics.

- Strategy modules focus on coherence, not consensus.

**Example**

Objectivity: "Here are three statistically best options."\
Alignment: "Given your energy, goals, and constraints --- this path
resonates most."

BrainFrame doesn't aim to be neutral. It aims to be true --- to you.

**Because in the end, alignment drives action. And action shapes
everything.**
