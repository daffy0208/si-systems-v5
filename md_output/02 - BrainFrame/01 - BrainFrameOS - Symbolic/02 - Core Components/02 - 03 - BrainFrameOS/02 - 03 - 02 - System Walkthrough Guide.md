**02 - 03 - 02 - System Walkthrough Guide**

**Purpose of This Guide**

This guide walks you through **how to activate and use BrainFrameOS**,
step by step. It shows how each part fits together and when to use which
component.

Think of this as your **orientation manual**.

**Step 1: Define Your System**

Start by creating your Framework and SelfFrame:

- Use \[02 - 01 - 02 - Framework Template.docx\] to define your Why /
  What / How

- Use \[02 - 02 - 01 - SelfFrame Template.docx\] to build out your
  personal operating system

These form the foundation of everything else.

**Step 2: Activate Your Weekly Rhythm**

Use the Shadow Planner to:

- Set intention at the start of each week

- Stay grounded in your Framework during the week

- Reflect and realign every Friday

Refer to \[02 - 04 - 01 - Shadow Planner Guide.docx\] for setup.

**Step 3: Add the Tools You Need**

Choose from a modular toolbox:

- Checklist Generator

- System Drift Detector

- Energy Planner

- Process Review Worksheet

Pick the ones that support how you think and work best. (See 02 - 05
series for each tool.)

**Step 4: Establish Validation Loops**

Use prompts and review logs to:

- Check alignment weekly

- Catch system drift early

- Build trust in your process

See:

- \[02 - 06 - 01 - Weekly Validation Prompts.docx\]

- \[02 - 06 - 02 - Review Log Template.docx\]

**Step 5: Configure Your AI Layer**

Teach ChatGPT (or another AI) to understand you:

- Load in your SelfFrame

- Use the prompt libraries

- Ask it to reflect *with* you, not just generate answers

See:

- \[02 - 07 - 01 - AI Configuration Guide.docx\]

- \[02 - 07 - 02 - Prompt Library.docx\]

**Final Notes**

- This system is modular --- build it at your pace.

- The goal is clarity, momentum, and alignment --- not perfection.

- You can come back to this guide any time you feel stuck, misaligned,
  or ready to expand.

You\'re not building a productivity system. You\'re building a
**thinking environment that evolves with you**.
