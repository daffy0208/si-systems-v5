**04-01 Perspective Multipliers**

Perspective Multipliers are advanced tools within BrainFrame designed to
accelerate insight by intentionally shifting, layering, or expanding how
a user views a situation, goal, or self-concept.

They are not about new data --- they're about new **frames**.

**Why They Matter**

- Most blocks are not due to lack of knowledge, but rigid perspective.

- Shifting frame = unlocking momentum.

- Multipliers help navigate complexity, paradox, or emotional fog.

**Core Types**

1.  **Time-Warped Thinking**

    - e.g. "How would Future You see this?"

    - e.g. "Zoom out to the 10-year lens."

2.  **Opposing Voices**

    - e.g. "What would your inner critic say? Your inner coach?"

    - e.g. "Play devil's advocate --- then play your strongest
      defender."

3.  **Systemic View**

    - e.g. "What role does this play in your larger system?"

    - e.g. "What dependencies are shaping this outcome?"

4.  **Symbolic Metaphors**

    - e.g. "If this were a landscape, what would it look like?"

    - e.g. "What animal or archetype are you being here?"

5.  **Energetic Checkpoints**

    - e.g. "What energy is this costing or generating?"

    - e.g. "Where is the tension in your body, your story, your time?"

**Integration in BrainFrame**

- Delivered via Prompt Library, Reflection Engine, or AI Companion.

- Can be triggered manually or contextually (e.g. during decision fog).

- Built into review rituals and meta-thinking sequences.

Perspective Multipliers don't give you answers --- they **give you new
ways to ask**.
