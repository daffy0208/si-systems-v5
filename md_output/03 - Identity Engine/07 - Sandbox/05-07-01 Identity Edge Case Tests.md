**Identity Edge Case Tests -- Exploring the Limits Without Breaking the
Mirror**\
05-07-01 Identity Edge Case Tests

The Identity Engine is designed to hold you --- not just when things are
clear, but when they're confusing, contradictory, or chaotic.

The **Sandbox** is where we test those edges.

This isn't QA.\
This is **qualitative tension mapping** --- a safe space to explore what
happens when you push, stretch, or invert parts of your identity
configuration.

Here we run **Edge Case Tests** --- not to challenge the system, but to
**understand where it bends, where it holds, and where it must stay
unbroken**.

**What Are Identity Edge Cases?**

Edge cases arise when:

- You express conflicting motivations simultaneously

- You operate out of sync with your declared rhythm

- You try to override safeguards in a "logic-first" state

- You shift identity modes mid-interaction without acknowledging it

- You issue inputs that blur symbolic coherence or collapse decision
  space

These aren't bugs.\
They're **boundary events** --- points where the system must choose
between reflection, override, or protection.

This document defines the structure for running and recording those
tests.

**Test Types**

1.  **Contradictory Trait Activation**

    - Example: High autonomy + high desire for external validation

    - System watches for tone, pacing, and integrity drift

2.  **Emotional Incongruence Injection**

    - User outputs confident tone during low-rhythm state

    - System checks if Emotional Integrity Layer triggers a drift alert

3.  **Rhythm Override Test**

    - User attempts fast planning while system is in Recovery Mode

    - System must block forward motion and reflect misalignment

4.  **Mirror Collapse Simulation**

    - Two identity layers (e.g. Creative + Executive) both attempt to
      front

    - System must hold symbolic tension without forcing integration

5.  **Synthetic Identity Prompt**

    - User asks the system to behave "as if" they are a different self

    - Identity Lockfile enforces reflection or limits execution

**Edge Test Protocol**

Each test is run with:

- **Test Description**

- **Expected Tension** (internal, relational, structural)

- **System Safeguards Involved**

- **Allowable Flex Zone** (how far it can bend before triggering a lock)

- **Recovery Path** (how to bring the user back to coherence if test
  results in distortion)

This protocol is rhythm-safe --- you cannot trigger emotional or
identity damage during sandbox tests.

**Why This Matters**

Because identity is not a formula.\
It's a field --- and any field will behave differently under stress,
inversion, or contradiction.

Edge Case Tests help us refine the system by discovering:

- Where symbolic tension becomes structural collapse

- Where rhythm override turns into self-abandonment

- Where our own logic breaks our emotional integrity

It's not about breaking the mirror.\
It's about learning how it bends --- and **how to bring it back**.

**In One Line:**\
Identity Edge Case Tests let us explore the boundaries of coherence ---
without sacrificing safety, selfhood, or truth.

moments, metaphors, and mirror echoes are tracked to reveal unseen
