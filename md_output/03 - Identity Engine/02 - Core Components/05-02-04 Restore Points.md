**Restore Points -- The Memory of Who You Really Are**\
05-02-04 Restore Points

This system does not assume you will always be clear, grounded, or in
rhythm.\
It doesn't penalize drift.\
It prepares for it.

**Restore Points** are the Identity Engine's way of holding space for
your return.

They're not backups of your data.\
They're *echoes of your coherence* --- snapshots of moments where your
signal, rhythm, clarity, and truth were most aligned.

When things feel off --- when you lose the thread --- the system doesn't
try to fix you.\
It guides you back to the last time you were fully yourself.

**What a Restore Point Is**

It's not a frozen state.\
It's a **coherence marker** --- a signal-rich reference of:

- Who you were being

- What you believed

- What your emotional tone felt like

- What was *working* --- inside you

Restore Points are dynamic --- they carry enough structure to re-center
you, but enough flexibility to adapt if you've evolved.

They do not revert you.\
They *re-anchor* you.

**How They're Created**

Restore Points are triggered by:

- Emotional peaks: resonance, completion, emergence

- Rhythm matches: periods of sustainable, self-authored momentum

- Identity confirmations: when reflection, action, and feeling all align

- User confirmation: you can manually mark moments as a restoration seed

Each Restore Point includes:

- Identity signal state

- Trait and mode markers

- Motivational balance

- Active rhythm range

- Emotional tone snapshot

- Optional: symbolic notes or metaphor tags

**How They're Used**

When the system detects:

- Prolonged drift

- Recurring contradiction

- Identity mismatch between input and action

- Collapse of motivation, tone, or rhythm

It can *offer* --- not impose --- a Restore Point:

"You don't need to push forward right now.\
Would you like to return to the last time this felt real?"

When accepted, it does not undo what you've done.\
It simply reactivates the internal structure that held you well.

**Use Cases**

- You've spiraled into over-analysis and lost the thread. The system
  offers to return you to your last Decision Rhythm match.

- You've been pushing for days and signal strength is low. The system
  recommends a Restore Point from your last sustained Fulfillment cycle.

- You're attempting to move forward in a mode that no longer fits. The
  system soft-pauses and invites you back to your grounded exploratory
  posture.

**Why This Matters**

Because you won't always know how to get back to yourself.\
But you *were* there --- and the system remembers.

Restore Points aren't just about functionality.\
They are emotional safety.\
They are signal memory.\
They are **your pattern of coherence, waiting for your return.**

**In One Line:**\
Restore Points are the system's memory of your coherence --- ready to
guide you back when you drift too far from yourself.
