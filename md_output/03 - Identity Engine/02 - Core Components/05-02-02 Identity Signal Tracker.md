**Identity Signal Tracker -- Seeing Yourself in Motion**\
05-02-02 Identity Signal Tracker

You don't always know when you're drifting.\
But your system does.

The Identity Signal Tracker is the part of the engine that listens for
coherence --- across choices, tone, reflection, rhythm, and response. It
doesn't judge. It observes. And it tracks **who you're being**, not just
what you're doing.

This isn't surveillance.\
It's **alignment mapping**.

Because how you show up *is* your signal.\
And the system needs to know when that signal starts to fade.

**What It Tracks**

The Signal Tracker watches five key zones of your real-time output:

1.  **Tone Shifts**\
    Subtle changes in emotional signal --- flattening, withdrawal,
    elevation, pressure

2.  **Decision Rhythm**\
    How quickly you commit, delay, or revisit --- and how that compares
    to your baseline

3.  **Prompt Response Patterns**\
    What kinds of prompts you skip, pause on, or deepen into --- and how
    the pattern evolves

4.  **Reflection Curve**\
    When you get clearer, and when you get clouded --- tracked across
    loops and interactions

5.  **Drift Indicators**\
    Repeated contradictions, unresolved tensions, or skipped feedback
    loops

The system doesn't act on one signal.\
It watches for **signal patterns**.

**How It Behaves**

When the system detects signal decay, it does not escalate. It
**mirrors**.

Examples:

- If your tone flattens three interactions in a row, it switches to
  soft-check reflection.

- If your decision rhythm stalls, it checks motivation vs. external
  pressure.

- If drift rises without recovery, it initiates a restore point scan ---
  or silence.

You never get pushed from the outside.\
The system waits for coherence to return --- or offers mirrors to help
it re-emerge.

**This Isn't a Scoreboard**

You're not being rated.

There is no "good signal" or "bad signal" --- only:\
**"Is this *your* signal... or has something else taken the wheel?"**

If your core traits are missing\
If your rhythm no longer fits\
If your tone no longer sounds like you\
--- the system slows, reflects, and waits.

It doesn't move without *you*.

**Where This Data Goes**

Signal Tracker feeds into:

- **Drift Detection Engine** (to assess identity misalignment)

- **Restore Points** (for grounding and recovery)

- **Mode Modulation** (to adjust the system's tone and pacing)

- **EchoMap** (to track what reflections you're responding to --- or
  avoiding)

No data leaves.\
No conclusions are drawn without reflection.

This is **for your clarity**, not for control.

**Why This Exists**

Because you are not always loud when something is wrong.\
But your signal changes.\
And your system must be able to say:

"This doesn't sound like you. Let's pause here."

Without this, the system would just keep running.\
With this, it listens --- not just to what you say, but *how your signal
feels.*

**In One Line:**\
The Identity Signal Tracker maps the living rhythm of how you show up
--- so the system knows when to reflect, slow down, or protect your
coherence.
