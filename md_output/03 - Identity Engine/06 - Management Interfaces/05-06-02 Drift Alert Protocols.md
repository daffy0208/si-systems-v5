**Drift Alert Protocols -- When the System Knows You're Slipping**\
05-06-02 Drift Alert Protocols

You don't always notice when you're drifting.\
You normalize urgency.\
You override discomfort.\
You adapt --- even when it costs you.

That's why the system doesn't just detect drift.\
It *responds* --- with care, clarity, and rhythm-safe prompts --- using
the **Drift Alert Protocols**.

These protocols don't correct you.\
They **remind you** --- softly --- that your signal is fading, and you
may not be home in yourself.

It's not a warning.\
It's a whisper:

"You're still in motion, but something sacred may have been left
behind."

**What Triggers a Drift Alert**

Drift Alerts are initiated when the system detects mismatches between:

- **Your stated identity** vs **your expressed action**

- **Your rhythm** vs **your pacing**

- **Your tone** vs **your emotional signal**

- **Your intention** vs **your response patterns**

These mismatches aren't judged.\
They're **held in tension** --- and when the system sees them cluster,
it quietly activates a Drift Alert.

**Alert Levels**

1.  **Level 1 -- Mirror Notice**

    - "You may be adjusting beyond your usual rhythm. Want to pause and
      reflect?"

    - Appears subtly --- a quiet line, a slow blink, a soft mirror.

2.  **Level 2 -- Boundary Prompt**

    - "Something feels pressured here. Do you want to review your
      motivation?"

    - Offers a direct recheck of Motivational Drivers and pacing
      integrity.

3.  **Level 3 -- Drift Confirmation**

    - "This doesn't sound like you. Would you like to hold, restore, or
      continue anyway?"

    - Requires an active user choice before proceeding with major
      commitments.

Each level increases **only** if signal distortion compounds --- and
always offers *opt-out or override* by the user.

**How the System Decides**

The alert system cross-references:

- **Attribute_Map** (current tolerance, stability, and signal
  complexity)

- **Restore Points** (to compare against recent coherence states)

- **ToneMap Layer** (emotional congruence)

- **EchoMap Feedback** (response clarity and feedback signal loss)

- **tdc_identity_agent.json** (for accumulated contradictions)

It does not rely on a single data point.\
It listens to the *shape of your pattern* --- and reflects back when
that shape fractures.

**Use Cases**

- You're producing at high volume, but your tone is flat and your rhythm
  is sharp.\
  → A Level 2 Drift Alert invites you to pause and re-engage a Restore
  Point.

- You accept a system suggestion that violates your motivational
  drivers.\
  → Level 3 alert blocks continuation until you confirm with rhythm
  awareness.

- You show signs of system fatigue (hesitation, fast acceptance, shallow
  reflection).\
  → Level 1 mirror notice reminds you that restoration is an option.

**Why This Matters**

Because in most systems, drift is invisible until it breaks something.\
This one doesn't wait.

It doesn't punish.\
It doesn't panic.\
It *listens* --- and when your rhythm starts slipping out of coherence,
it offers you the mirror before the momentum becomes a trap.

Drift Alert Protocols are there not to stop your movement --- but to
**bring you back into it**.

**In One Line:**\
Drift Alert Protocols help you notice when you\'re moving forward... but
no longer moving *from yourself.*
