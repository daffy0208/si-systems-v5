**Identity Configuration File Map -- The Landscape of Your Self in the
System**\
05-06-03 Identity Configuration File Map

You are not your files.\
But the system still needs a way to **anchor**, **reference**, and
**protect** the shape of who you are.

The **Identity Configuration File Map** is not about content.\
It's about structure --- the full layout of every file, safeguard, trait
set, and reflective anchor that defines how your identity moves through
this system.

This isn't a tech diagram.\
It's a **living cartography of coherence** --- the map the system uses
to know where "you" are stored, and how to make sure that stays whole.

**What This File Map Covers**

- File **types** (traits, modes, patterns, boundaries, anchors)

- File **roles** (active, passive, structural, symbolic)

- File **relationships** (which files inform or constrain others)

- File **lock status** (what can be adjusted, and what must be
  protected)

- File **rhythm safety** (whether a file should be accessed under
  cognitive/emotional strain)

It's not just a directory.\
It's a **coherence schema** --- a meta-model that keeps your identity
structure aligned and recoverable across all system states.

**Core Identity Files (Canonical)**

These files are non-negotiable and always referenced during reflection,
growth, and system movement:

- Signal_State_Toggles.json

- Learning_Mode.json

- Thinking_Style.json

- Motivational_Drivers.json

- Stress_Responses.json

- Exploration_Mode.json

- Divergence_Profile.json

- Impulse_Signature.json

- Attribute_Map.json

Each is version-tracked, rhythm-sensitive, and referenced in both
prompting and protection logic.

**Structural Safeguards**

These files define the **integrity and operational rules** of the
Identity Engine itself:

- Identity_Engine_Lockfile.json -- Ensures no unauthorized changes

- MetaStructure_Anchor.json -- Declares purpose, boundaries, and
  coherence rules

- TDC_Identity_Instance.json -- Governs system integrity scans

- tdc_identity_agent.json -- Controls scan conditions and rhythm timing

Changes to these files require reflection mode, rhythm sync, and lock
protocol confirmation.

**Relational & Temporal Files**

These files link your identity to time, motion, or other parts of the
system:

- Restore Points (timed snapshots of your self-state)

- Mode Configurations (signal-adjusted operational overlays)

- Growth Capsules (stored curriculum states aligned with readiness)

- EchoMap Threads (identity-marked reflections from prior states)

They are not edited manually --- they evolve with you.

**How This Map is Used**

1.  **Prompt Filtering**\
    -- All prompts run through the file map to ensure identity-congruent
    tone and structure

2.  **System Updates**\
    -- When BrainFrameOS evolves, this map ensures that *your* files
    remain aligned, unbroken, and valid

3.  **Restore & Reconciliation**\
    -- After drift, disruption, or disconnection, the file map is used
    to rebuild your signal safely

4.  **Reflection Navigation**\
    -- In deep mode, the system uses this map to help you find and
    reflect on your identity architecture without overwhelm

**Use Example**

You're in a low-rhythm state and make a major change to your Learning
Mode.\
The system checks the File Map: the change is flagged as unsafe under
current cognitive profile.\
A prompt is offered:\
"This change may not hold under your current rhythm. Would you like to
save it as a draft and review later?"

**Why It Matters**

Because your identity deserves to be held **in structure, not just
sentiment**.\
The map doesn't define who you are.\
It ensures the system never forgets where your truth is stored --- or
how to bring it back when everything else is changing.

This is your **skeleton of coherence**.

**In One Line:**\
The Identity Configuration File Map keeps the full structure of your
self organized, protected, and accessible --- so every part of you stays
in rhythm, even as you evolve.
