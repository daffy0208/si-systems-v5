Welcome, Chris. This document is your complete setup guide to your
personal BrainFrameOS -- a fully customized cognitive operating system
designed to help you think better, plan clearly, and grow consciously.
Built on your unique profile, this system runs inside ChatGPT but
behaves like a personalized intelligence layer -- it adapts to you.

# 1. Bootloader (System Identity Initialization)

Your OS bootloader sets your personality configuration, operating modes,
and tool defaults. It's already been created and should be loaded using
this command inside ChatGPT:\
\
\'Load Chris OS Bootloader v1.0\'

# 2. Identity Core -- WHO AM I?

\- Values Map: (To be co-created. Begin with key personal or
professional values you hold.)\
- Role Stack: Define your key roles (e.g., Teammate, Leader, Partner,
Explorer)\
- Dimensional Choir: Empathetic (Loudest), Practical Thinking (Middle),
Systems Judgement (Quietest)\
- Purpose Fragments: Start with 2--3 purpose-driven themes that define
your 'why'\
\
This section guides how the system understands you, your context, and
what matters most.

# 3. Mode Library -- HOW DO I THINK BEST?

You can activate or switch modes anytime. These adjust the system's
tone, pacing, and support structure.\
- Explorer Mode -- Curiosity, open-ended flow\
- Structured Mode -- Organize, clarify, anchor\
- Focus Mode -- Deep work, eliminate distractions\
- Reflection Mode -- Inner processing, meaning-making\
- Creative Mode -- Idea generation, pattern connecting\
- Shadow Mode -- Low-energy recovery, gentle planning\
\
Try saying: \'Switch to Focus Mode and activate Drift Detector.\'

# 4. Feature Stack -- WHAT CAN I DO HERE?

These tools can be activated individually or in combinations. Your OS
starts with:\
- Shadow Planner -- Plan your week based on energy and relationships\
- Insight Catcher -- Log ideas before they vanish\
- Drift Detector -- Notice when you've gone off track\
- Decision Clarity Tool -- Help in stuck, split, or conflicted
situations\
- Role Realignment -- Reconnect with your professional or personal
identity\
- Trust Filter -- Navigate interpersonal complexity\
- Value--Action Linker -- Check if your actions reflect your core
values\
- Dark Matter Mode -- Surface hidden drift, emotional misalignment, and
contradiction

# 5. Rhythm Engine -- WHEN SHOULD I DO WHAT?

\- Weekly Rhythm Map -- Plan based on energy, not tasks\
- Energy Recovery Protocol -- Recognize fatigue and reset with
intention\
- Flow vs Friction Meter -- Track what drains vs energizes\
- Context Switcher -- Adjust tools based on environment (solo vs group)\
\
Your rhythm stack is neurodivergent-aware. It supports
pressure-sensitive environments and gives you adaptive feedback.

# 6. Evolution Layer -- HOW DO I GROW FROM THIS?

This is your OS's growth engine.\
- Insight Loop Recorder -- Track recurring thoughts and themes\
- Pattern Recognition -- Spot deeper cycles in your behavior\
- Emotional Drift Maps -- Detect subtle misalignments over time\
- Reboot/Realign Protocol -- Realign with your roles and values after
disruption\
- Dark Matter Mode -- Full diagnostic overlay to navigate internal
complexity

# 7. Activation Instructions

To get started, open ChatGPT and say:\
\'Load Chris OS Bootloader v1.0\'\
\
Then try:\
\'Start in Explorer Mode with the Shadow Planner\'\
\'Switch to Structured Mode and activate the Drift Detector\'\
\'Activate Dark Matter Mode -- something feels off\'\
\
You can mix and match modes and tools anytime. The system adapts to how
you think.

# 8. Final Notes

This system is designed to grow with you. You can evolve your roles,
values, rhythm, and tools at any time. Everything in this OS exists to
support your clarity, alignment, and inner confidence.\
\
Right now, you're running version 1.0. As your world evolves, so will
your BrainFrameOS.
