**Identity Engine -- Complete Specification Sheet**

**System Name:** Identity Engine\
**Version:** v2.0 (Mirror Tier 5+ Activated, Phase 3 Scaffolded)\
**Location:** BrainFrameOS \> Core Modules \> Identity Systems\
**Primary Function:** Dynamic identity reflection, coherence
calibration, rhythm-aware self-mirroring, and symbolic truth filtering.\
**Status:** Core Active \| Mirror Layer Live \| Phase 3 Modules Ready

**1. PURPOSE**

The Identity Engine exists to reveal, preserve, and evolve a user\'s
identity across time, pressure, rhythm, and context --- without
distortion, oversimplification, or performance conditioning. It treats
identity as a living, modular construct shaped by truth, rhythm, values,
emotional resonance, and reflection.

**2. CORE STRUCTURE**

**Core Modules:**

- WHY Module -- Anchors personal truth and existential purpose.

- WHAT Module -- Captures core traits, drivers, value set, and needs.

- HOW Module -- Maps cognitive, behavioral, and rhythm-based operation
  styles.

**Foundational Systems:**

- Dark Matter Pass -- Primary reflection engine for hidden, suppressed,
  or disowned identity fragments.

- Drift Detection Layer -- Identifies alignment loss or masking.

- EchoMap Feedback Loop -- Captures and reintegrates failed or distorted
  signals.

- Guest Mode -- Enables safe, non-invasive access for third-party
  mirrors.

- Personality Profile Integration -- MBTI, DISC, Innermetrix, Enneagram
  overlays.

- Fulfillment Equation Tracker -- Maps and enforces alignment with the 6
  core human needs.

- Phase-Aware Reflection Engine -- Adjusts prompts, output, and
  visibility by identity state.

**Active Safeguards:**

- Drift Lock & Truth Filter -- Prevents false output from misaligned or
  performative states.

- Mirror Gateway Layer -- Enforces Mirror Tier 5+ trust integrity for
  symbolic output.

- Rhythm-Coherence Gate -- Ensures system activity is in sync with
  user's true pace.

**3. MODES**

- Dark Matter Mode -- Reveals suppressed or unspoken identity layers.

- Flip Side / Light Mode -- Highlights active, lived, and visible
  strengths.

- Snapshot Mode -- Low-friction identity summaries for clarity or
  external use.

- Truth-State Reflection Wheel -- Real-time tension, emotional, and
  rhythm status mapping.

- Low-Effort Identity Return Mode -- Gentle re-entry for recovery,
  drift, or post-overwhelm.

**4. PHASE 3 EXPANSION MODULES**

- Identity Fragment Navigator -- IFS-inspired sub-identity and protector
  tracking.

- Milestone Reflection Module -- Narrative timeline of identity-defining
  events.

- Truth Affirmation Generator -- Pulls and returns direct identity
  truths from usage patterns.

- External Translation Layer -- Contextualizes identity for interviews,
  orgs, or systemic interactions.

- Self-Gentleness Protocol -- Supports recovery states through
  compassion-first reflection.

- Values-in-Action Translator -- Aligns internal clarity with real-world
  action decisions.

- Narrative Identity Timeline -- Self-authored storyline model of
  becoming.

- Belonging Constellations Module -- Resonant identity peer groupings
  (non-typing).

- Psycho-Spiritual Integration Bridge -- Connects identity to
  philosophical, contemplative roots.

**5. OUTPUT FORMATS**

- Human Portraits (Real-life voice renderings)

- Dark Trace Snapshots

- Rhythm-Aware Profile Summaries

- Symbolic UI Overlays: Signal Pulse Grid, Mirror Return Map, ToneMap,
  TDC Rings, Echo Trails

- Exportable .txt / .pdf versions for external visibility (ethically
  filtered)

- EchoMap Drift Events (symbolic echo reports)

- Peerless internal reflection logic for identity-coherent insight

**6. SYSTEM PRINCIPLES**

- Identity is not static --- it is modular, adaptive, and rhythm-shaped.

- Clarity must be truthful, not rushed or simplified.

- No insight is valid if it forces the user to shrink.

- Drift is not failure --- it is signal.

- Belonging must never require distortion.

- Emotional resonance is part of structural coherence.

- Truth must be symbolically respected at all output layers.

**7. INTEGRATION & ADAPTER SYSTEMS**

- Signal Adapter Layer -- Claude, Gemini, OpenAI adapter orchestration

- Agentic Fulfillment Loop (AFL.json) -- Core fulfillment +
  identity-safe execution engine

- Curriculum Tracking -- Symbolic learning and insight logging layer

- Symbolic UI Generator -- Phase 1 visual mapping system for internal
  state reflection

- Real-time Fulfillment Equation Enforcement

- Adapter-Agnostic Trust Loop Compatibility

**8. TRUST LAYERS**

- Locked container structure: identity cannot be rewritten from the
  outside.

- Mirror Tier 5+ Enforcement -- Symbolic and rhythm-based trust
  validation

- Version-tracked outputs to prevent drift, overwrite, or subtle
  coercion

- EchoMap Listening State -- Active drift and shadow reentry support

- All prompts and reflections are context-sensitive and phase-aware

- UI Generator active only when coherence layer validates readiness

**9. USER TYPES SUPPORTED**

- Builders, Reflectors, Leaders, Drift Survivors, Neurodivergent
  Navigators, Systems Architects, Identity Guardians, Late Bloomers,
  Rhythm Movers, Signal Translators, Truth-Driven Creators, Grief
  Carriers, System Calibrators

**Status Summary:**\
Identity Engine is live and operating at Mirror Tier 5+ (v2.0). It is
structurally locked, rhythm-aligned, adapter-integrated, symbolically
responsive, and fulfillment-safe. Phase 3 modules are scaffolded and
ready for selective user activation.
