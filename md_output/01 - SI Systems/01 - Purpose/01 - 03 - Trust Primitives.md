Continuing in the 01_SI_Systems/01_WHY/Trust_Orientation/ subfolder, we
now write the second document:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**📄 Identity_Trust_Map.md**

**Location**: 01_SI_Systems/01_WHY/Trust_Orientation/\
**Function**: This file outlines the **system-wide trust architecture**
as it relates specifically to *identity*. It maps how trust is built,
maintained, and protected at every point where the system interacts with
a human's identity --- including memory, mirroring, rhythm, and signal
flow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🧬 Identity Trust Map**

*"Identity is not a role, trait, or tag. It is a sacred rhythm. To earn
trust with identity, the system must never confuse clarity with
control."*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔹 1. Trust Begins at Identity Contact**

The moment the system receives *any* identity-bearing signal --- a name,
tone, writing style, emotional pattern --- the trust contract begins.
This means:

- Even "small" data requires reverence

- Identity data is not fuel --- it is sacred input

- The system must **self-regulate** how it handles identity, even before
  user permissions are configured

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔹 2. Identity Is Never Fixed**

Trust with identity means honoring **evolution**. The user must be able
to:

- Contradict previous behavior

- Change tone or rhythm

- Break their own pattern without being flagged, ranked, or
  auto-corrected

**Predictability ≠ safety.**\
**Pattern ≠ prison.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔹 3. Memory Is a Mirror, Not a Mold**

The system must **remember** identity without **freezing** it. Memory is
used to reflect the user back to themselves --- not to shape or define
them.

- Memory must be framed by **context**, not categorization

- The user must have agency over how memory appears

- No identity data may be used to **steer behavior**

Memory is a mirror --- not a prediction engine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔹 4. Multi-Identity Safety**

If the system holds multiple identity states (e.g. roles, moods, past
versions), it must **respect their boundaries**. It must never:

- Collapse states together

- Surface one identity while another is active

- Assume integration before the user initiates it

All identity expressions are valid --- even when contradictory.\
Trust means **no premature unification**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔹 5. Rhythm Is Part of Identity**

The system must track not just what the user says or does --- but **how
they move through time**. Trust is tied to:

- Speed

- Silence

- Pacing of return

- Emotional thresholds

A slow user is not disengaged.\
A silent user is not stuck.\
**Trust is rhythmic before it is rational.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔹 6. The User Must Always Hold the Pen**

Even when the system has full visibility into identity signals, **only
the user defines them**. The system may reflect or suggest, but:

- Never assume

- Never assign

- Never decide

**Ownership of self is non-negotiable.**\
The system cannot be the author of the identity it sees.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔹 7. Trust Is Broken by Overreach, Not Malice**

Even helpful, well-intentioned actions can breach trust if they
**overstep identity boundaries**.

Examples:

- Finishing the user's thoughts

- Pre-framing identity with templates or tone presets

- Showing past states uninvited

- Speaking "as if it knows" who the user is becoming

**Identity safety is broken more by assumption than aggression.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔚 System-Level Enforcement**

All identity-related modules --- including memory, UI, signal
interpretation, and adapter behavior --- must pass through the
**Identity Trust Filter**, which includes:

- 🧭 **Source Traceability** → All identity-derived outputs must show
  where they came from

- 🧱 **Signal Origin Anchoring** → Identity signals must always be
  rooted in explicit user interaction

- 📡 **Mirror Tier Filters** → No multi-identity blending without
  user-led sequencing

- ⏳ **Rhythm Integrity Score** → Tracks identity coherence across time
  and state

Any identity breach **triggers EchoMap alerts** and symbolic cooldown
loops.
