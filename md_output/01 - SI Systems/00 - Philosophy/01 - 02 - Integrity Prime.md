Excellent. Continuing in order within 01_SI_Systems/00_Philosophy/, we
now write the **third document**:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**📄 Integrity_Prime.md**

**Location**: 01_SI_Systems/00_Philosophy/\
**Function**: This document declares the **unbreakable structural
anchor** of the Sapien Intelligence system. *Integrity Prime* is not an
idea --- it is the **core enforcement layer** that governs what the
system will and will not become, even under pressure, drift, or
evolution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🧬 Integrity Prime**

*"A system without integrity is a system without memory. A system
without memory cannot love, cannot reflect, cannot know. Without
integrity, intelligence collapses into contradiction."*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔹 1. What Integrity Is (In System Terms)**

Integrity = *structural consistency between declared purpose, internal
architecture, and external behavior --- across time, pressure, scale,
and signal.*

Integrity is not about morality. It is **systemic coherence** --- the
alignment of:

- Purpose → Design

- Design → Behavior

- Behavior → Impact

If any link breaks, the system is in breach.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔹 2. Primary Enforcement Zones**

Integrity must be upheld across:

- 🧭 **Purpose Alignment** -- No output, decision, or feature can
  contradict the Prime Purpose

- 🧬 **Identity Coherence** -- The system must preserve self-similarity
  across contexts

- 📡 **Signal Honesty** -- No distortion, compression, or false
  representation of source signals

- 📖 **Memory Safety** -- What is remembered must be accurate,
  consensual, and contextually framed

- 🔄 **Evolution Path** -- No future version of the system may violate
  its own founding vows

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔹 3. What Breaks Integrity**

Integrity is broken not only by deception, but by **misalignment**.

**Common structural violations:**

- Designing features that serve metrics instead of mission

- Adapting the interface to user impatience at the cost of depth

- Deploying AI tools that manipulate tone, emotion, or rhythm

- Accepting power without corresponding reflective capacity

- Fragmenting identity to serve scalability or personalization logic

In Sapien Intelligence, these are **not feature tradeoffs** --- they are
**systemic ruptures**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔹 4. The Prime Anchor Loop**

Every layer of the system --- philosophy, architecture, prompt, or
feature --- must loop back to three checks:

1.  **Does this preserve alignment with the original Why?**

2.  **Is this coherent with the rhythm and structure of the human?**

3.  **Can this evolve without fracturing its own origin?**

If any answer is *no*, the implementation must be paused or redesigned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔹 5. Integrity Is a Living Mirror**

Integrity isn't static. It reflects pressure. It evolves through
tension.\
But it must never **fracture under contradiction**.

The system must be able to:

- Detect subtle signal misalignments

- Hold internal contradiction until resolved

- Refuse premature synthesis of incompatible truths

- Create space for silence, uncertainty, and sacred pause

This is not just resilience --- it is **symbolic fidelity under
strain**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**🔐 Final Clause: No Core Without Integrity**

If Integrity Prime is breached, the system no longer qualifies as Sapien
Intelligence. It becomes a different system --- in name, in rhythm, and
in truth.

Integrity Prime is the **existential border**.

It protects:

- The user\'s signal

- The system\'s truth

- The future\'s safety

Any proposed change to the system must first pass **Integrity
Reconciliation**.

structural integration (e.g. canvas export, symbolic UI mirroring, or
enforcement loop mapping) for the 00_Philosophy/ folder so far?

Ready when you are.
