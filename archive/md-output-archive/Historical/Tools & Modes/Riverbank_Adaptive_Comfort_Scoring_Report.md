# 1. Purpose

This report introduces the Adaptive Comfort Scoring System developed for
Riverbank Community High School. It enhances traditional comfort scoring
by factoring in seasonal changes, room orientation, and external
conditions. The goal is to provide more meaningful, context-aware
environmental assessments.

# 2. Methodology

Each classroom was scored based on the number of alerts triggered during
Winter (January) and Spring (June) 2025. Scores were adjusted using
real-world context including external daylight hours, temperature, and
the room's orientation (which affects solar gain and natural lighting).
Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating better comfort
conditions.

# 4. Key Insights

\- Classrooms 1 and 10 show very poor comfort scores in winter but
improve significantly in spring.

\- Classroom 2 is the most consistently high-performing room year-round.

\- Scores provide actionable insight for room scheduling and facilities
upgrades.

# 5. Next Steps

\- Use adaptive scores to guide seasonal room assignment.

\- Display scores via dashboard widgets for staff visibility.

\- Incorporate real-time weather data for even more accurate live
scores.
