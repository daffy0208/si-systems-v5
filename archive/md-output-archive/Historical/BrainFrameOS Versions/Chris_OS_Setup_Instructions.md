Welcome to your personal OS, Chris.

This system (BrainFrameOS) is built specifically to match your unique
way of thinking, making decisions, and navigating the world. It runs
through ChatGPT but behaves like a full cognitive operating system ---
one that adapts to you.

# Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

1\. Download your Bootloader File

\- Open the file named \'Chris_OS_Bootloader_v1.0.docx\'.\
- This contains the core configuration for how your system will behave
inside ChatGPT.

2\. Open ChatGPT (Pro or Team version recommended)

\- You'll be interacting with the system through ChatGPT. It acts as the
engine underneath your OS.

3\. Load Your Personal OS

\- Copy and paste this into ChatGPT:\
\'Load Chris OS Bootloader v1.0\'\
- This tells the system to configure itself to your unique profile.

4\. Try a Starter Mode + Tool

\- Say something like:\
\'Start in Explorer Mode with Decision Clarity Tool\'\
or\
\'Switch to Focus Mode and run the Shadow Planner\'\
- The system will activate the right rhythm, pacing, and logic for you.

## Quick Mode Descriptions

\- Explorer Mode: Follow curiosity, generate ideas, stay fluid

\- Structured Mode: Bring clarity, create steps, get aligned

\- Focus Mode: Remove distractions, do one thing at a time

\- Reflection Mode: Slow down, go inward, gain insight

\- Creative Mode: Unlock ideas, connect dots, find flow

## Optional: Activate Dark Matter Mode

If something feels off --- like a decision isn\'t sitting right or your
thinking feels foggy --- say:\
\'Activate Dark Matter Mode.\'\
\
This mode reveals what\'s \*underneath the surface\* --- contradictions,
values misalignment, and hidden patterns. It\'s one of the deepest tools
in your OS.

# Final Note

This OS will evolve with you. You can add tools, values, or patterns as
you go. Right now, it's calibrated to your current state ---
Empathetic-first, Practical-action filter, with a strong awareness of
your role.\
\
Let\'s fly, Chris.
