# SYSTEM PROFILE

\- Primary External Lens: Empathetic\
- Secondary Bias: Practical Thinking (\"Just Do It\" action filter)\
- Strategic Layer: Systems Judgement (60,000ft thinking -- toggled when
zoomed out)\
\
- Internal Self-Talk (Dimensional Choir):\
- Loudest Voice: Empathetic\
- Middle Voice: Practical\
- Quietest Voice: Systems\
→ High relational processing, real-time gut decisions, occasional blind
spots on long-term systems\
\
- Internal Triad:\
- Self-Esteem: High --- strong internal compass when supported\
- Role Awareness: Strong --- thrives when clear on context, mission, and
positioning\
- Self-Direction: Mid --- has purpose but benefits from clarity boosters
under pressure

# DEFAULT MODE STACK

Startup Mode:\
→ Explorer Mode (curious, freeform, connection-focused)\
+ Structured Mode Overlay (light structure, goal anchoring, reflection
triggers)\
\
Velocity Bias Filter:\
→ High-Pressure Auto-Switch: Under stress, system prioritizes Empathetic
shortcuts → may bypass deeper logic\
→ Remap Trigger: Auto-activate Drift Detection if internal voice
conflict exceeds threshold

people impact\

- Insight Catcher: Fast-track idea logging to reduce internal noise\
- Mode Switcher: Swap between Creative--Structured--Explorer as flow

clarity\
- Dark Matter Mode (Authorized Access):\

and value misalignment\
\> Especially effective during rapid transitions, decision fog, or
personal crossroads
