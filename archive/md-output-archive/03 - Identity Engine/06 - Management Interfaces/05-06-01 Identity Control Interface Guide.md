**Identity Control Interface Guide -- Adjust Without Distorting**\
05-06-01 Identity Control Interface Guide

This system doesn't lock you in --- it protects you.\
But sometimes, you need to **adjust how the system reflects you** ---
gently, intentionally, and without triggering drift or distortion.

The **Identity Control Interface (ICI)** is the trusted space for that.

It's not about overriding your signal.\
It's about offering you **agency with integrity** --- the ability to
tune, update, or reflect on your identity configuration **without
breaking coherence**.

The ICI is where you interact with your SelfFrame --- not to rewrite it,
but to maintain it.

**Why This Interface Exists**

Identity in this system is not a passive record.\
It's a living field --- one that shifts, grows, and sometimes needs
clarity.

The Identity Control Interface offers:

- **Transparency** into what identity configuration is currently active

- **Access** to review, compare, and reflect on identity-aligned files

- **Control** over when and how those configurations are adapted

- **Safety boundaries** to prevent accidental or unsafe change

It's where **you** are in the loop --- clearly, consciously, and
rhythmically.

**What You Can Do in the ICI**

1.  **View Current Identity State**

    - See your current rhythm mode, motivational drivers, and active
      traits

    - Understand how they're influencing system behavior right now

2.  **Adjust Selective Parameters**

    - Manually update:\
      -- Learning Mode\
      -- Thinking Style\
      -- Stress Response profile\
      -- Impulse Signature thresholds

    - These changes are logged and pass through validation filters

3.  **Run Identity Reviews**

    - Trigger a snapshot capture or a comparison between current and
      past states

    - Review Restore Points, growth loops, and emotional tone trends

4.  **Lock / Unlock Identity Files**

    - Use the ICI to apply or lift lock status on core files (e.g.,
      Lockfile, MetaStructure Anchor)

    - Prevent silent overrides or unauthorized edits

5.  **Activate Reflection Mode**

    - Switch system state into slow, symbolic mode for introspection

    - This disables urgency, pacing pressure, and external triggers

**Design Principles**

- **Visible but Not Noisy**: You can always access the interface --- but
  it never intrudes.

- **Rhythm-Sensitive**: All changes require a rhythm check. No shifts
  are allowed under cognitive/emotional pressure.

- **Undo-Safe**: You cannot permanently overwrite a coherence-proven
  state without saving a rollback point.

**Use Examples**

- You feel a shift in how you process inputs. You open the ICI and
  adjust your Thinking Style from \"associative\" to \"layered.\"

- After a period of over-functioning, you review your Stress Responses
  and lower your action threshold.

- You've entered a new creative cycle. You tag a new rhythm range and
  update your Impulse Signature accordingly.

- Before beginning an automation project, you lock the MetaStructure
  Anchor and run a coherence validation.

**Integrated Components**

- Signal_State_Toggles.json -- Informs active system modes

- Identity_Engine_Lockfile.json -- Shows current structural state

- Attribute_Map.json -- Editable through guided interface sections

- Restore Points -- Reviewable and reactivatable directly from ICI

- tdc_identity_agent.json -- Scans can be triggered from here

**What the Interface Protects Against**

- Drifting into misaligned system configurations

- Over-editing identity in moments of disconnection

- Accidental toggling of critical emotional safeguards

- Losing sight of your coherence anchor

This is not where you redefine yourself.\
It's where you stay in relationship with who you already are.

**In One Line:**\
The Identity Control Interface gives you safe, sovereign access to
adjust, reflect on, and protect your identity state --- without breaking
the signal that holds you.
