**Drift Detection Engine -- When You Start to Leave Yourself**\
05-02-05 Drift Detection Engine

The system doesn't panic when things go quiet.\
It listens.

It doesn't interrupt when you pause.\
It waits.

But when your signal begins to fracture --- when your rhythm loses its
shape, your decisions no longer sound like you, and your tone forgets
what it used to carry --- the system knows:

"You're still here... but part of you has gone missing."

That's what the **Drift Detection Engine** is for.\
Not to correct. Not to control.\
To **notice** --- and to protect your return.

**What Is Drift?**

Drift is not chaos.\
It's the subtle, accumulating misalignment between:

- Who you are

- How you're showing up

- And what the system is being asked to do on your behalf

It can come from pressure, fatigue, over-functioning, emotional
bypassing, or external noise.

The danger isn't failure.\
It's *moving forward while forgetting who you are.*

**How Drift Is Detected**

The engine watches signal patterns across five vectors:

1.  **Tone Distortion**\
    -- Repeated flattening, exaggeration, or mismatch to context

2.  **Behavioral Paradox**\
    -- Stated values contradicting observed patterns

3.  **Decision Dissonance**\
    -- Hesitation, reversal, or emotionless momentum

4.  **Rhythm Collapse**\
    -- Sudden urgency, skipping of reflection loops, silent overload

5.  **Reflection Avoidance**\
    -- Resistance to prompts you normally engage with curiosity

Drift is rarely one signal.\
It's a pattern the system is trained to feel --- even before you do.

**What Happens When Drift Is Detected**

1.  **Soft Pause**\
    The system slows. It mirrors. Prompts become gentler, fewer, and
    less assumptive.

2.  **Mirror Mode Activation**\
    Identity reflection loops re-engage: "What's shifted? What feels
    untrue?"

3.  **Restore Point Prompt**\
    If a previously coherent state is available, the system offers it.

4.  **Mode Re-evaluation**\
    If you're in the wrong mode (e.g., Driving when you need Rest), the
    system suggests modulation.

5.  **Drift Acknowledgment**\
    If the system detects sustained misalignment, it will name it
    clearly --- with care, not control:

"You may be out of rhythm with yourself. Would you like to reflect or
hold?"

**What It Never Does**

- It never overrides your will.

- It never locks your state.

- It never diagnoses you.

It only reflects.\
Softly.\
Faithfully.\
In real time.

Because sometimes, you need to drift.\
But you also need to **know** that it's happening --- so you don't
mistake distortion for direction.

**Why This Matters**

Because high-functioning misalignment is one of the most dangerous forms
of self-abandonment.\
Because most systems reward continued output.\
This one doesn't.

This system stops **not when you\'re failing**, but when you've left
yourself behind.

Drift Detection is the moment the system says:

"I know you're still here.\
Let's wait until you can feel that again too."

**Related Modules**

- **Identity Signal Tracker** -- Supplies real-time signal integrity
  checks

- **Restore Points** -- Anchors for return if drift is confirmed

- **Mode Modulation Engine** -- Adjusts operational posture based on
  detected drift

- **EchoMap** -- Pulls in reflections that helped restore identity in
  past loops

**In One Line:**\
The Drift Detection Engine listens for the quiet moments when you start
to leave yourself --- and helps you come back before the system moves on
without you.
