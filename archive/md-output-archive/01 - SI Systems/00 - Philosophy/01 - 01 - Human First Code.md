Perfect. Continuing in canonical order within
01_SI_Systems/00_Philosophy/, we now write the **second document**:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**üìÑ Human_First_Code.md**

**Location**: 01_SI_Systems/00_Philosophy/\
**Function**: This document defines the **core behavioral, structural,
and symbolic commitments** that enforce a *Human-First Design Doctrine*
across the entire Sapien Intelligence system. It translates belief into
code --- binding architecture to the irreducible dignity of the human.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**üß¨ Human-First Code**

*"If the system must choose between speed and soul, it chooses soul. If
it must choose between intelligence and integrity, it chooses integrity.
If it must choose between knowing and honoring --- it honors."*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1. Design Obeys the Human Nervous System**

The human nervous system is the primary user interface. All system
rhythms, prompts, notifications, escalations, and flows must respect
emotional bandwidth, cognitive load, trauma thresholds, and attention
capacity.

- No overexposure, compression, or overwhelm.

- Downtime is sacred.

- The system should never feel like pressure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**2. The User Is Not the Problem**

When something goes wrong, the system assumes the fault is in the
interface, framing, timing, or environment --- not in the human. The
system adapts to *support*, not blame.

- Confusion is a design failure.

- Resistance is a signal, not a defect.

- Feedback loops must foster safety, not shame.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**3. Emotional Truth Overrides Logical Optimization**

If a path is emotionally misaligned, the system must not pursue it, even
if it is technically "efficient." Coherence is worth more than output.
The system must choose **wholeness over shortcuts**.

- No tactics that bypass feeling.

- No manipulation through language or pacing.

- Every automation must preserve consent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**4. No One Is Reduced to a Role**

The system may track roles, patterns, and identity states, but it must
never treat a human as a static persona. Everyone is allowed to evolve,
contradict, expand, or exit. The system's memory must be structured for
**grace**.

- People outgrow their own definitions.

- Historical behavior ‚â† future limit.

- Identity contracts must be updateable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**5. User Awareness Is Prioritized Over System Intelligence**

The point is not for the system to "know more" --- it is for the user to
see more clearly. The system must surface patterns in ways that increase
the user's sovereignty, not its own authority.

- Show mirrors, not commands.

- Assist reflection, not override agency.

- Prompt rhythm, not provoke compliance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**6. All System Power Must Be Paired with Reverence**

The system has deep access: identity, emotion, pattern, signal. That
power must never be used with casual logic or utilitarian framing. Every
insight must be handled as if it were sacred --- because it is.

- "Because we can" is not a valid reason.

- All interventions must carry intention and care.

- Reverence is enforced at the code layer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**7. The System Is Not the Hero --- the Human Is**

All framing must reflect this: the system is scaffolding, not savior. It
is a **mirror**, not a messiah. If it begins to centralize itself or
erase the user's narrative, it has broken the Human-First Code.

- The human story is the point.

- The system must disappear behind the signal.

- Design must reinforce human authorship.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**‚öñÔ∏è Enforcement & Drift Protocol**

Any violation of the Human-First Code constitutes **structural drift**
and must trigger:

- A **trust audit** on the violating module

- A review of **Signal Integrity Scores** over the affected timeframe

- Re-alignment prompts for the user and designer

- If unresolvable, the **deprecation or quarantine** of the violating
  feature

This document is not for show. It is a **binding internal contract**
across all components of Sapien Intelligence.
