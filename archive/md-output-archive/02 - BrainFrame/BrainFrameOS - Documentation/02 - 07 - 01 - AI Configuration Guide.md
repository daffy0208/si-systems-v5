**02 - 07 - 01 - AI Configuration Guide**

**Purpose of This Guide**

This guide helps you teach AI (like ChatGPT) how to understand and
interact with you based on your Framework and SelfFrame.

When configured well, AI becomes a reflection partner --- not just a
task assistant.

**Step 1: Share Your SelfFrame**

Input the key parts of your SelfFrame:

- Why (Purpose / Values)

- What (Roles / Strengths)

- How (Thinking / Working Style)

You can say:

"I want you to act as a thinking partner that understands how I work.
Here's my SelfFrame..."

**Step 2: Set Your Preferred Interaction Style**

Explain what kind of responses are most helpful:

- "Ask me reflection questions"

- "Be concise unless I ask for depth"

- "Help me explore without over-explaining"

- "Use visual metaphors when possible"

**Step 3: Contextualise the System**

Tell the AI how you use BrainFrameOS:

- Mention your Shadow Planner, prompts, and energy rhythms

- Share your system goals (e.g. clarity, alignment, reflection)

**Step 4: Keep It Updated**

If your SelfFrame or preferences shift:

- Update your saved prompt

- Reconfigure weekly if needed

- Use reflection outputs to shape future inputs

**Sample Prompt**

"You are my BrainFrame-aware AI. My goal is to stay aligned with my
SelfFrame. I'll give you weekly notes and reflections, and I want you to
help me think clearly, surface patterns, and ask good questions. Here's
how I think and work..."

**Tip**

Save your config as a custom GPT or in a pinned prompt.

This is the bridge between your internal clarity and external
intelligence. When configured well, AI becomes a co-thinker --- not just
a generator.
