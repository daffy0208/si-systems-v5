**07-02 Prototype Planner Pages**

These pages contain experimental planning layouts not yet formalised
into core BrainFrame modules. They are designed to be used, modified, or
discarded depending on what works best in real use.

**Prototype 1: Dual-Momentum Map**

- **Purpose:** Contrast Internal vs External momentum

- **Sections:**

  - Current Internal Drivers (desire, energy, focus)

  - Current External Drivers (deadlines, demands, signals)

  - Misalignments

  - Leverage Points

**Prototype 2: Friction Audit**

- **Purpose:** Identify subtle blockers to progress

- **Sections:**

  - Physical Friction (space, health)

  - Emotional Friction (doubt, resistance)

  - Systemic Friction (tools, clarity)

  - Friction â†’ Flow rewrite prompts

**Prototype 3: Weekly Spiral Planner**

- **Purpose:** Replaces linear weekly plans with a spiral model

- **Sections:**

  - Center: Core focus / theme

  - 1st Ring: Must-dos

  - 2nd Ring: Want-to moves

  - 3rd Ring: Flow / Serendipity items

**Use Notes**

- These pages are intentionally raw.

- Users can sketch, annotate, or remix directly.

- If patterns of usefulness emerge, they may be promoted to full
  modules.

**All good systems start in the margins.**

These prototype pages are yours to explore.
