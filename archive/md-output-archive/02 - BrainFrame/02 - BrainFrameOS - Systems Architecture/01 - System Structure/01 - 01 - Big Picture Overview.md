**🪞 0. ORIGIN CONTEXT: WHY BRAINFRAMEOS WAS BUILT**

BrainFrameOS was created not as a planning tool --- but as a **response
to a failure** in how AI engages with real human cognition.

The founder (a high-velocity decision-maker with ADHD-patterned
cognition) noticed that **every AI session reset context, misunderstood
rhythm, ignored emotional signal, and drained trust**.

AI wasn't wrong --- it was just misaligned.

What was missing wasn't intelligence. It was a **system** that could
mediate between *how a human thinks* and *how a model processes* ---
preserving both clarity and identity.

That became BrainFrameOS.

**🔧 1. SYSTEM FUNCTION OVERVIEW**

**System Name**: BrainFrameOS\
**Version**: v5.1.1 -- "Thegither" Layer\
**Function**: Bidirectional identity-aware OS layer that translates
between **human signal** and **AI model response** --- preserving
clarity, memory, rhythm, and trust.

**BrainFrame sits between two dynamic entities**:\
One human, one model.\
It protects both --- and improves both.

**⚖️ 4. SYSTEM EQUATION**

Clarity×Rhythm×Alignment=ValidMomentumClarity × Rhythm × Alignment =
Valid Momentum

If any element drops below threshold, **momentum is denied** --- whether
from human-driven urgency *or* AI-generated suggestion.

**🧠 5. TEMPORAL TRACE: REAL FLOW**

**Scenario**: A user asks Claude to help reprioritize their week.

1.  **Input captured** → passes through Mirror Gateway for emotional
    drift or tone mismatch

2.  SelfFrame injects known context: low energy, unfinished Friday loop,
    priority inversion

3.  BrainFrame tools activate Shadow Planner and Checklist Generator

4.  Fulfillment Equation halts premature output

5.  EchoMap recalls unresolved task chain from last Thursday

6.  **Wrapped AI prompt sent** --- now with true context

7.  AI response returned → scanned again → **delivered only if
    rhythm-safe**
