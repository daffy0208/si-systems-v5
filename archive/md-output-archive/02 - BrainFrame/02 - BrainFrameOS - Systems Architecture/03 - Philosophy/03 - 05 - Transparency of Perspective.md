**03-05 Transparency of Perspective**

In BrainFrame, truth is rarely absolute. But perspective is always
present.

Rather than pretending to be neutral, BrainFrame operates from a core
value: **transparency of perspective is more useful than the illusion of
objectivity**.

**Why It Matters**

- Every system embeds assumptions --- about humans, value, growth,
  success.

- AI responses are shaped by framing, tone, and philosophical defaults.

- Users deserve to know the lens they're looking through.

**What It Looks Like**

- BrainFrame modules clearly express their underlying purpose and design
  logic.

- Prompts disclose their intended tone and frame (e.g. challenge,
  comfort, clarity).

- System behaviours adapt based on user-aligned values (e.g. curiosity,
  impact, integrity).

**Benefits**

- Builds trust with the user.

- Enables meaningful disagreement or refinement.

- Avoids manipulation or unintentional bias reinforcement.

- Allows users to shape the lens --- not be shaped by it invisibly.

**Example: Prompt Clarity**

Instead of: "List 5 things you're grateful for."\
BrainFrame says: "Gentle prompt for emotional grounding. Would you like
to explore gratitude or shift focus elsewhere?"

Transparency doesn't mean oversharing. It means owning the frame --- so
users can choose their own.

In BrainFrame, perspective isn't hidden. **It's part of the dialogue.**
