**05-03 Team & Org Expansion (Preview)**

This preview outlines how BrainFrame evolves from an individual system
to a **shared thinking infrastructure** for teams and organisations.

**Core Shifts**

- From internal clarity → to collective alignment.

- From personal reflection → to strategic coherence.

- From individual insight → to distributed sensemaking.

**1. Shared Frameworks**

- Teams adopt core modules (e.g. Clarity Snapshots, Shadow Reviews) with
  shared language.

- Alignment spectrums and tension maps used in meetings.

**2. Role-Based SelfFrames**

- Each member builds a SelfFrame that reflects their:

  - Motivations

  - Strengths

  - Cognitive style

  - Communication preferences

These are used to:

- Reduce friction

- Increase empathy

- Tailor feedback & collaboration

**3. AI-Aware Collaboration**

- AI adapts tone, prompts, and framing for each team member.

- Team-wide reflections allow divergence before convergence.

- Shared decision logs allow retrospective insight without blame.

**4. Strategy & Culture Modules**

- Values Alignment Canvas

- Vision Anchor Mapping

- Cultural Tension Scanner

BrainFrame at the team level enables:

- Deeper strategic alignment

- More human-centred management

- Less noise, more meaning

This is the future of organisational thinking: **personal agency +
collective intelligence**.
