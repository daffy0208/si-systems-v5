**04-02 Spectrum Modelling Overview**

Spectrum Modelling is a method used in BrainFrame to replace binary
thinking with dynamic, contextual insight.

Rather than forcing either/or decisions, Spectrum Modelling visualises
ideas, behaviours, and strategies along a **continuum** --- allowing
users to locate themselves, explore alternatives, and make aligned
adjustments.

**Why Spectrums?**

- Most decisions are not black or white.

- Growth often lies in movement, not category.

- Spectrums allow nuance, fluidity, and self-awareness.

**Core Axes Examples**

- **Structure \<------------\> Freedom**

- **Depth \<------------\> Speed**

- **Intuition \<------------\> Logic**

- **Self-Oriented \<------------\> System-Oriented**

- **Stability \<------------\> Change**

**Use Cases**

- Reflective prompts: "Where are you on this spectrum today?"

- Team alignment: map each member's tendencies across key spectrums.

- Decision calibration: check where a current strategy sits --- and
  where it *should*.

**Integration in BrainFrame**

- Used in SelfFrame profiles, Strategy Builders, and Adaptive AI tuning.

- Included in visual dashboards or reflection modules.

- Can be tracked over time for growth trends or tension patterns.

Spectrum Modelling doesn't just describe where you are.\
**It helps you move with intention.**
