**08-01 Intro Guide for New Users**

Welcome to BrainFrame --- your thinking partner, clarity engine, and
reflective system.

This guide is designed to give you a smooth, meaningful start. No
overwhelm. Just momentum.

**What BrainFrame Is**

- Not an app. Not a productivity hack.

- It's a system for **seeing your thoughts**, tracking your growth, and
  making aligned decisions --- supported by AI.

**What You'll Use It For**

- Thinking clearly when life gets complex

- Designing your week with purpose

- Making better decisions with less stress

- Reflecting meaningfully --- and acting with insight

**How to Begin (Simple Start Path)**

1.  **Pick One Prompt**

Try: "What do I actually need right now?"

2.  **Choose One Module**

Start with the **Shadow Planner** or **Prompt Library**

3.  **Set Your Tone**

Do you want gentle nudges or clear structure? Pick your vibe.

4.  **Use Once Per Day**

Morning calibration or end-of-day check-in works best

**Principles to Remember**

- No pressure to "do it right" --- this is yours to shape

- Your thinking style is welcome --- chaotic, structured, visual, or
  emotional

- You don't need to fill everything in. You just need to show up

**Optional Tools**

- Shadow Planner (track energy, tension, and flow)

- SelfFrame (map who you are and how you grow)

- AI Companion (talk things through, reflect, ideate)

**First Reflection Prompt**

*"What do I want this system to do for me --- really?"*

You're not behind. You're right on time.

**Welcome in. Let's think clearly --- together.**
