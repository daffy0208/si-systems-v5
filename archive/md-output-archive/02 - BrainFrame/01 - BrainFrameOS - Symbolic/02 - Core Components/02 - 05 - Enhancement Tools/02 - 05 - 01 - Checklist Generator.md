**02 - 05 - 01 - Checklist Generator**

**Purpose of This Tool**

The Checklist Generator is a practical extension of your BrainFrame
system. Its job is simple: **turn insight into action**. Whether it
comes from a Shadow Planner reflection, a breakthrough thought, or an AI
session, this tool helps you break down clarity into momentum.

This is where "I should\..." becomes "I will."

**How to Use It**

**Step 1 --- Capture the Insight**

Write the core idea, reflection, or intention you want to act on.

*Example: "I need to protect my deep work time better."*

**Step 2 --- Break It Into Actionable Steps**

Take your insight and extract 3--5 steps that would bring it to life.

*Example:*

- Block deep work slots in calendar (2x 90 mins)

- Turn off notifications during those slots

- Let team know about availability windows

**Step 3 --- Create the Checklist**

Turn those actions into a clear, visual checklist you can work through.

☐ Block time for deep work

☐ Mute notifications

☐ Inform team of new boundaries

**Template**

**Insight / Reflection / Intention:**

You can print this page, duplicate it weekly, or keep a running list in
your Shadow Notes.

**When to Use This**

- After completing your Shadow Planner (Friday reflection)

- After an insight in a conversation with ChatGPT

- When you feel stuck but suddenly get a burst of clarity

- After journaling or reviewing a drift pattern

**Pro Tip**

Pair this with:

- **Energy Planner** (02 - 05 - 03) to prioritise your checklists by
  energy availability

- **System Drift Detector** (02 - 05 - 02) to respond to breakdowns with
  specific actions

- **AI Prompting Layer** (02 - 07 - 02) to ask ChatGPT to help turn
  vague ideas into defined lists

Keep it light. The power isn't in perfect formatting --- it's in using
this often enough to build momentum from your own insight.
