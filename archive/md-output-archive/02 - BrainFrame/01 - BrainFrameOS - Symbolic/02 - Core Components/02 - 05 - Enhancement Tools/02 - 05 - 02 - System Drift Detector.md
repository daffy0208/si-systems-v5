**02 - 05 - 02 - System Drift Detector**

**Purpose of This Tool**

This tool helps you detect when your personal system is drifting out of
alignment.

Drift doesn't always show up as failure --- sometimes it looks like
success with the wrong feeling underneath. This worksheet helps you
identify subtle signs before they become major misalignments.

**Drift Detection Prompts**

Ask yourself:

- Am I doing things that look right but feel off?

- What part of my system feels like friction right now?

- When was the last time I felt genuinely energised by this system?

- Am I performing or aligning?

- Have I drifted from my Why / What / How?

**Checkpoints**

**1. Energy Check**

- Do I feel drained by processes I designed?

- Is my motivation coming from clarity or pressure?

**2. Alignment Check**

- Are my current actions aligned with my SelfFrame?

- Am I honouring my natural working style?

**3. System Review**

- Which tools still feel useful?

- What's become performative, bloated, or unnecessary?

**Reset Options**

If drift is detected:

- Revisit your SelfFrame (02 - 02 - 01)

- Simplify your planner setup (02 - 04)

- Drop tools that no longer serve

- Update your Framework or AI config

**When to Use**

- Monthly or quarterly check-in

- When friction or fatigue becomes persistent

- When results don't match your inner sense of progress

This tool helps restore **trust** in your system by realigning it to
you.
