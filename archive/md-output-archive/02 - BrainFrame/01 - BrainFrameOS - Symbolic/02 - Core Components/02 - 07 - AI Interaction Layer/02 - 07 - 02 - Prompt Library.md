**Purpose of This Library**

This is your prompt vault for interacting with AI in a way that reflects
your SelfFrame and supports your BrainFrameOS system.

It's not about clever tricks --- it's about asking the right questions
in your voice, for your system.

**Reflection Prompts**

- "What patterns are emerging in my recent notes?"

- "Where might I be drifting from my SelfFrame?"

- "What am I avoiding that could unlock progress?"

- "Can you help me surface insights from this week's planner?"

- "Which actions are aligned vs reactive this week?"

**Planning Prompts**

- "Based on my energy this week, what would be a smart way to plan it?"

- "What roles do I need to lean into this week?"

- "How can I protect deep work without overloading?"

- "Help me translate this clarity into a checklist."

**Decision Prompts**

- "What decision best aligns with my Why?"

- "Which option supports my sustainable momentum?"

- "What would each path look like if I played it out?"

- "What's the fear behind this hesitation --- and is it valid?"

**Debugging Prompts**

- "Something feels off in my system --- can we unpack it?"

- "Which tool might be creating friction?"

- "Can you help me run a system drift check?"

**Expression Prompts**

- "Can you help me articulate my mission in clearer language?"

- "Let's rewrite my SelfFrame in a simpler voice."

This is your voice --- extended. Keep evolving it.
