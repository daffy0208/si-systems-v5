**ðŸŸ¢ BrainFrame - Context Management Guide**

**âœ… Purpose**

**To clearly manage the addition and removal of customer-specific
contexts, ensuring neutral and consistent interactions.**

**ðŸŸ¢ Adding Customer-Specific Contexts**

1.  **Clearly identify the new customer\'s name or project.**

2.  **Summarize key requirements, preferences, or guidelines relevant to
    the interaction.**

3.  **Explicitly mark these details as customer-specific context for
    clarity.**

4.  **Verify the context entry for accuracy and completeness.**

**ðŸŸ¢ Removing or Clearing Contexts**

1.  **Upon completion of a customer engagement or when context is no
    longer relevant, clearly identify which contexts are to be
    removed.**

2.  **Confirm removal to ensure no residual information remains.**

3.  **Conduct a quick validation check:**

    - **Confirm that no previous customer-specific context persists.**

    - **Ensure the baseline remains neutral and ready for new
      interactions.**

**âœ… Best Practices**

- **Regularly perform context checks before starting a new engagement.**

- **Keep context summaries clear, concise, and relevant.**

- **Always verify neutrality after context removal to maintain integrity
  of interactions.**
