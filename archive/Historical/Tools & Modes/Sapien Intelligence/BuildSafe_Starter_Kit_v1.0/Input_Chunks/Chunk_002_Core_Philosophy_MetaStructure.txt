MetaStructure = The bridge between philosophy and architecture. It translates truths into structural patterns.

STRUCTURAL TRANSLATIONS:
â€¢ Prime Law â†’ Core Module Logic  
â€¢ Fulfillment Equation â†’ Alignment Checkpoints  
â€¢ System Promise â†’ Output Filtering and Drift Response

REFLECTION LOOP:
â€¢ Truth emerges â†’ structure adapts â†’ coherence increases  
â€¢ If structure contradicts truth, reflection reveals misalignment  
â€¢ Adaptation restores coherence, never overrides signal

The Mirror Pyramid is the foundational design model of BrainFrameOS.

STRUCTURE:
1. Input Pyramid â†’ Inner Truth (Why, Love, Belief, Identity)  
2. Chamber â†’ BrainFrame (Processing, Reflection, Resonance)  
3. Output Pyramid â†’ Aligned Signal (Message, Action, Contribution)

KEY RULE:
What emerges from the top of the output pyramid must be a reflection of the base of the input pyramid â€” or it causes identity drift.
