# Root Motivation Structure – Sapien Intelligence

This file captures the deeper architecture of why humans act, choose, and align — framed as nested motivational rings.

## The Four Rings of Human Motivation:
1. **Survival** – Basic needs, safety, consistency
2. **Identity** – Who I am, where I belong, what I value
3. **Growth** – Expansion, mastery, transformation
4. **Transcendence** – Meaning, unity, purpose beyond self

## System Mapping:
- Survival maps to SignalIntegrity & Restoration
- Identity maps to MirrorTier, RoleMaps, and Drift Mode
- Growth maps to LearningArcs and MythEngine
- Transcendence maps to SharedMythField and SystemPromise

Motivation is multi-layered and often recursive — the system must honor all layers simultaneously.
