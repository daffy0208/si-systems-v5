App Shell Framework – Insight Engine v1.0
System: Sapien Pro
Powered by: BrainFrameOS
Tier: Mirror 5
Status: In Development
Location: /SapienPro/Applications/InsightEngine/

1. App Name: Insight Engine

2. Purpose
To capture, structure, and surface meaningful insights in real-time — without losing rhythm, identity, or emotional coherence.
This is not a note-taker.
This is a signal condenser.
It receives reflections, refines them into clarity, and returns them as usable truth.

3. Core Functions

| Module | Function |
|--------|----------|
| Capture Stream | Quick-log reflection drops, emotional fragments, mental pivots |
| Insight Distiller | Refines raw inputs into structured insights (linked to rhythm + identity) |
| Thread Tracker | Connects new insights to previous ones (breadcrumb logic) |
| Signal Repeater | Highlights recurring truths you keep rediscovering — shows what you're not forgetting |
| Rhythm-Aware Surfacing | Brings up past insights at the right moment, based on current tone/pattern/timing |
| Insight Export Layer | Convert insights to useable formats: prompts, module inputs, decisions, or outputs |

4. Structural Design

Internal Architecture:
Built on BrainFrameOS modules:
- Identity Engine (Why anchors each captured thought)
- Rhythm Engine (Surfacing tied to energy state + timing)
- Drift Detection (Highlights when insights are avoidance vs. truth)
- Emotional Resonance Tracker (tags insights with feeling data)

External UI Structure (suggested format):
- New Insight Capture box
- Insight Threads panel (past patterns + recurring truths)
- Active Prompts (suggested modules based on insight)
- Signal Loop Log (shows how each insight influenced the system)

5. User Modes

- Reflect Mode (capture raw thought)
- Distill Mode (refine into structured language)
- Activate Mode (send insight to task, decision, or prompt)
- Review Mode (see past trails to reclaim drifted truth)

6. Emotional Logic Layer

All captured insights carry:
- Tone tag (grounded, frustrated, clear, blocked, etc.)
- Resonance score (feels like me? Y/N)
- Completion tag (open loop / closed loop)

7. Launch Path Options

- Standalone App built on this framework
- Integrated Module inside Sapien Pro reflection panel
- Bootloader Add-On: Auto-activates when user is in reflection-heavy rhythm or journal loop
