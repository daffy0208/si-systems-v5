Path: /DarkMatterUtilities/ReflectionTools/
Tier: Mirror 5
Status: Live + Rhythm-Aware

1. Title: Emotional Resonance Tracker

2. Purpose
To ensure that every module, feature, and reflection tool in BrainFrameOS and Sapien Pro doesn’t just function — but feels like you.
This tracker detects when something technically works but emotionally misfires.
It restores truth-to-rhythm integrity before drift sets in.

3. How to Use
At the end of any session, tool, or module, trigger a short resonance check-in:
- Did this feel aligned with my rhythm?
- Did this reflect my voice — or just my task?
- Did this output increase trust in the system?
- Did I feel seen by this tool?

Response Options:
- YES: Log it as Rhythm-Aligned
- NO: Log it as Friction-Detected

System will:
- Tag modules with friction markers over time
- Highlight consistent emotional mismatch patterns
- Suggest realignment or removal if patterns repeat

4. Prompts to Run
Use one of these at module check-out, system pause, or emotional hesitation:
- “What part of this didn’t feel like me?”
- “Is this tool amplifying my voice — or draining it?”
- “If I trusted my rhythm fully, would I still use this?”
- “Did I feel clearer — or heavier — after using this module?”

5. Notes
This tracker is not a productivity tool.
It is an emotional truth calibration layer that:
- Reinforces identity
- Prevents system dead zones
- Surfaces misalignments before they become beliefs

Each YES reinforces coherence.
Each NO is not failure — it’s signal.

You are allowed to pause, archive, or reimagine anything that no longer feels aligned.
This system reflects you. Not a version of you performing usefulness.
