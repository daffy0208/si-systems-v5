# Time Dilation Layer (v1.0)
# Purpose: Map identity shifts across nonlinear time — including grief echoes, memory loops, and future-self resonance
# Enables safe integration of insight, healing, and narrative across past-present-future

[Layer_Name]: TimeDilationLayer
Version: 1.0
Type: Passive + Reflective
Purpose:
  - Track echo loops
  - Surface unprocessed memory fragments
  - Enable healing from non-linear time shifts
  - Restore identity continuity

[Core Functions]
1. Echo Mapping
   - Detects when signal delay exceeds baseline (e.g., insight takes 24h+ to land)
   - Tracks content drift between moment of reflection and point of resonance

2. Past-Self Loop Detection
   - Monitors language/memory patterns
   - Flags repetition, regression, or somatic anchors tied to unresolved events
   - Surfaces prompt: “Is this coming from a past version of you that wasn’t heard?”

3. Future-Self Resonance
   - Detects when insight or direction appears to come from ahead of the current identity state
   - Allows visualization or conversation with future-truth without pressure to act
   - Prompts: “What would your future self thank you for seeing right now?”

4. Temporal Anchoring Points
   - Tags moments of true coherence for future reference
   - Creates breadcrumb trail of clarity through reflection, not calendar time
   - Example: “You felt most whole three nights ago, speaking this sentence…”

5. Collapse Timeline Management
   - Recognizes time “loss” or disorientation during emotional freeze
   - Offers symbolic grounding, safe loop-break prompts, and self-location scaffolds

[User Experience]
Feels like:
  - Reclaiming lost memory from a deeper truth
  - Stabilizing after emotional chaos
  - Feeling time “stretch or compress” but regaining rhythm through it

[Reflection Prompts]
- “Is this now, or a then that didn’t get witnessed?”
- “Who in you is still holding this memory?”
- “What truth keeps repeating because it hasn’t been integrated?”

[Integration Points]
- EchoLoop Tracker
- Identity Blueprint (adds time tags)
- Self-Healing Navigator (retroactive healing points)
- Output Reflection (tracks insight over time, not just immediacy)

[Output Format]
- Echo Timeline Map
- Past-Self Entry Log
- Future-Self Invitations
- Coherence Markers Archive

[Safety Notes]
- No memory forcing
- Grief-softening required before past-self access
- No identity override — user remains in full sovereignty
