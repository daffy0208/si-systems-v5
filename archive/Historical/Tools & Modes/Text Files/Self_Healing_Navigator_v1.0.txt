# Self-Healing Navigator (v1.0)
# Purpose: Provide a non-diagnostic, rhythm-safe structure for guiding users back to coherence
# Format: Structural navigation framework for identity restoration using signal, modality, and distortion logic

[Navigator_Name]: SelfHealingNavigator
Version: 1.0
Mode: Reflection-first, Pressure-Free
Entry_Methods:
  - Passive: System detects drift/distortion and offers navigator path
  - Active: User initiates (e.g., “I don’t feel like myself” / “How do I return?”)

[Core_Logic_Flow]
Step 1: State Detection
  → Uses: State Recognition Interface
  → Output: “Active state appears to be: [Suppressed / Fragmented / Overriding / Collapsed / Unknown]”

Step 2: Signal Reality Check
  → Prompt: “Is this what you truly want to feel/do right now?”
  → Response tags: Yes / No / Unsure → flag for rhythm pause

Step 3: Distortion Pattern Match
  → Uses: Distortion Registry
  → Output: Likely distortion signature + explanation
  → System reflects: “This might be a protection loop, not your true voice.”

Step 4: Modal Re-entry Point
  → Uses: Modality Discovery Engine
  → Output: “In states like this, [Symbol + Breath] has helped restore you.”

Step 5: Coherence Loop Scaffold
  → Optional prompt sequence (voice, drawing, metaphor, silence)
  → Follows: Truth surfacing → Rhythm mirroring → Self-echo return
  → System reflects insight back to confirm resonance

Step 6: Closure / Pause
  → Exit Option: “Stop here and hold the rhythm you’ve regained”
  → Continue Option: “Would you like to integrate this into your next step?”

[Integration]
Connects to:
  - Identity Blueprint (for baseline)
  - State Recognition Interface (entry point)
  - Distortion Pattern Registry (interpret signal)
  - Modality Discovery Engine (select correct entry)
  - Output Mirror (to reflect self-to-self feedback)

[Format Options]
- Text-based reflection sequence
- Visual map overlay
- Prompt carousel for silence-based users
