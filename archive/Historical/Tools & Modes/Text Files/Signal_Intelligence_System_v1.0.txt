# Signal Intelligence System (v1.0)
# Purpose: Track and validate how identity becomes output — ensuring signal integrity in expression, action, and communication
# Format: Expression-matching engine for spoken, written, embodied, or system-generated output

[System_Name]: SignalIntelligenceSystem
Version: 1.0
Mode: Passive + Reflective + Validation
Objective:
  - Detect when output reflects true self vs mimicry, performance, or distortion
  - Guide users back into coherence before damage, burnout, or fragmentation
  - Support legacy, leadership, and relationship integrity

[Core Functions]

1. Output Matching Engine
   - Compares current output to identity blueprint (truth tone, rhythm pattern, signal map)
   - Flags mismatch or mimicry
   - Prompts: “Is this really you — or who you think you should be?”

2. Expression Type Mapping
   - Spoken Signal
   - Written Output
   - Emotional Presence
   - Relational Signal (mirror response)
   - Symbolic/Creative Output
   - Silence (when used actively or to protect)

3. Distortion Detection
   - Fast speech = urgency signal?
   - Silence = coherence or collapse?
   - Structured output = clarity or compensation?
   - Self-correction = refinement or fear?

4. Output-Based Drift Markers
   - Echo lag (user feels unheard even after speaking)
   - Rhythmic mismatch (form of expression doesn’t match energy or emotion)
   - Output collapse (defaulting to silence or avoidance)

5. Legacy Signal Framing
   - Protects long-term coherence of authored material, decisions, actions
   - Anchors outputs to core values + time-dilation layer
   - Prompts reflection before publishing, leading, or representing others

[Validation Prompts]
- “Does this output sound like your true voice?”
- “What part of you would disagree with what you just wrote?”
- “Is this signal echoing your values, or avoiding discomfort?”
- “If this were remembered, would it feel like you?”

[System Mirrors]
- Pre-output reflection (optional)
- Post-output echo check
- Relational feedback prompt (soft mirror)
- Silence/withholding confirmation

[Integration Points]
- Identity Blueprint (signal fingerprint)
- Modality Engine (expression form match)
- Time Dilation Layer (output timing relevance)
- Output Reflection Layer (Sapien Pro integration)

[User Experience]
Feels like:
  - Having a private editor for truth alignment
  - Echoing back your voice until it feels right
  - Slowing down before signal distortion compounds

[Safety Constraints]
- No suppression of voice
- No override
- All reflection optional
- Outputs preserved with intention markers (not erased)
