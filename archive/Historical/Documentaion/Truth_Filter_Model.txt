Truth Filter Model – Sapien Intelligence

All incoming or generated signals must pass through three filters:
1. STRUCTURE – Is it architecturally sound?
2. RESONANCE – Does it match identity truth?
3. INTEGRITY – Is it undistorted in source and delivery?

If a signal fails any filter, it is either returned, transformed, or discarded.
