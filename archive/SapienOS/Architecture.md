# System Architecture Overview

## Objective

This document explains the structural layout of the human–AI coherence framework.  
It consists of three functional layers that work together to preserve alignment, identity integrity, and output safety — without modifying the underlying AI model.

## Layer Model

### 1. Purpose Layer  
Defines the **user’s intent, values, tone profile, and goal orientation**.  
All interactions are measured against this layer to ensure alignment.

- Holds long-term user objectives
- Establishes tone and communication boundaries
- Provides clarity during complex or ambiguous sessions

**Analogy**: Mission control for meaning and direction.

---

### 2. Coherence Layer  
Manages **session rhythm, consistency, emotional tone, and identity preservation**.  
This is the engine that detects and responds to drift, distortion, or structural mismatch.

- Coordinates the Scan Engine, Drift Detection, and Fulfillment Checks
- Routes prompts and outputs through rhythm-aware evaluation
- Maintains emotional and cognitive stability throughout the session

**Analogy**: Runtime environment with built-in integrity checks.

---

### 3. Interface Layer  
Handles all **input/output interaction with the AI model**.  
Ensures signal safety, prompt integrity, and output filtering.

- Dynamically generates prompts based on user rhythm and structure
- Filters outputs before they reach the user
- Routes signal adjustments upstream when integrity is at risk

**Analogy**: Guardrail-enabled I/O layer between user and model.

## Diagram Reference (for future integration)

A simplified block diagram can be added using tools like:

- Mermaid.js for Markdown-native rendering
- SVG/PNG export from Figma or Whimsical
- Static architecture graphic (recommended filename: `architecture-diagram.png`)

Diagram Components:
- Three horizontal layers (Purpose / Coherence / Interface)
- Vertical signal flow: User → Prompting Engine → AI → Filter → User
- Feedback loops: Scan/Drift Detection route back to Prompting Engine

## System Principles Recap

| Principle               | Implementation Layer |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Identity Preservation   | Purpose + Coherence  |
| Emotional Safety        | Coherence + Filter   |
| Output Trust            | Interface + Scan     |
| Prompt Adaptation       | Interface + Coherence|
| Drift Correction        | Coherence            |
