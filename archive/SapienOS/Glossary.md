# Glossary of Terms

This glossary defines important terms used across the system documentation.  
Each entry is written for clarity, precision, and practical understanding.

---

### Alignment
The process of ensuring the AI model’s outputs remain consistent with the user’s intent, goals, tone, and values — beyond technical correctness.

---

### Bidirectional Translation
The ability for both the human and the AI to speak in their natural language or rhythm while still being correctly interpreted and respected by the system.

---

### Coherence
The internal consistency of a signal (input or output), measured across logic, tone, purpose, emotional tone, and timing.

---

### Drift
Any gradual misalignment or shift in the tone, purpose, structure, or rhythm of an interaction over time — either from the user or the AI.

---

### Drift Detection
The system’s ability to monitor, flag, and respond to subtle signs of misalignment in communication style, clarity, tone, or goal focus.

---

### Emotional Integrity
Ensuring the output respects emotional safety, avoids manipulation or mischaracterization, and preserves the user’s emotional tone.

---

### Fulfillment Alignment
A check to determine whether the interaction serves the user's deeper intention — not just their immediate instruction.

---

### Identity Match
The preservation of the user’s linguistic, emotional, and tonal signature in interactions with AI — preventing the model from reshaping how the user expresses themselves.

---

### Output Filter
A checkpoint that examines all AI-generated outputs to confirm they meet tone, rhythm, and structural requirements before delivering them to the user.

---

### Prompting Engine
A dynamic pre-processing system that converts user inputs into structured, context-aware prompts optimized for AI systems — without compromising the user's intent or tone.

---

### Rhythm
The pacing, flow, and expressive tempo of a conversation or output. Changes in rhythm can signal fatigue, emotional shift, or structural misalignment.

---

### Scan Engine
A system module that evaluates the structure, tone, rhythm, and coherence of all outputs using a defined set of dimensions (e.g., logical coherence, emotional alignment).

---

### Signal
Any unit of communication — a prompt, response, phrase, or message — that passes between user and AI.

---

### Tone Profile
A user-defined (or inferred) configuration that describes preferred emotional tone, formality, assertiveness, and expression style across all interactions.

---

### Trust Boundary
A defined threshold beyond which AI-generated responses are considered too distorted, risky, or unfaithful to the user’s purpose and must be blocked or corrected.

---

### User Rhythm
A composite profile of how a user typically communicates — including pacing, sentence length, emotional tone, directness, and style.

## Notes

This glossary will evolve.  
New terms should be submitted via PR and written in plain language, ideally under 60 words.
