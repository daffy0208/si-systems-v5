# Multi-Dimensional Scan Engine

## Purpose

The Scan Engine is designed to evaluate **inputs, outputs, and intermediate system states** using a structural framework that goes beyond surface accuracy.

Its role is to ensure that every signal (from the user or AI) is:
- Contextually accurate
- Structurally aligned with the user’s stated purpose
- Emotionally and tonally appropriate
- Free from drift, flattening, or distortion

---

## What It Scans

Each scan is performed across multiple dimensions:

| Dimension           | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Logical Coherence   | Does the signal make structural sense? |
| Rhythm              | Is the pacing, tone, and style consistent with the user’s norm? |
| Purpose Alignment   | Is this serving the user's declared goals or values? |
| Emotional Integrity | Is the tone stable, non-manipulative, and in-range for the context? |
| Identity Match      | Does the phrasing match the user's linguistic signature? |
| Symbolic Noise      | Are there unintended shifts in meaning, tone, or self-concept? |

## When It Runs

- **On Every Input** from the user before reaching the model  
- **On Every Output** from the model before reaching the user  
- **On Demand** — for reflective insight, recalibration, or external audit

---

## Example: Output Scan

**Input Prompt**:  
> “Summarize this business proposal in a way that aligns with my leadership tone.”

**Scan Result Before Output**:
- Logical Coherence: ✅  
- Rhythm: ⚠️ (too rushed, overly compressed)  
- Purpose Alignment: ✅  
- Emotional Integrity: ⚠️ (borderline passive-aggressive tone)  
- Identity Match: ❌ (phrasing inconsistent with user’s typical vocabulary)

**Action Taken**:  
Output blocked. Feedback sent to Prompting Engine for adjustment.

## Developer Notes

- Scan dimensions are modular and customizable  
- Weighting logic can be adapted per use case (e.g., emphasize tone fidelity for leadership users)  
- Future versions may expose scan API externally for plug-in integration or independent audit
