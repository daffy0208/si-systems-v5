# Contribution Guide

This system is designed to evolve through open, structured collaboration — focused on **signal integrity**, **alignment safety**, and **scalable trust** in human–AI systems.

Whether you’re an engineer, researcher, designer, or strategist, this guide explains how you can contribute effectively.

## Contribution Principles

1. **Preserve User Identity**  
   Every module must protect the user’s cognitive, emotional, and linguistic fingerprint.

2. **Avoid Model-Centric Bias**  
   This is not about maximizing LLM performance — it’s about **preserving coherence** in the interaction layer.

3. **Structure Over Speed**  
   Changes that introduce drift, abstraction, or rhythm loss — even if efficient — are discouraged.

4. **Clarity First**  
   Contributions should be understandable to others within 60 seconds of reading.

5. **Modularity Always**  
   All contributions must remain plug-and-play. No hard dependencies, no hidden state.

## Where to Contribute

| Area                | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Prompting Engine** | Add templates, tones, role configs, or adaptive logic |
| **Scan Engine**      | Improve dimension scoring, add custom axes |
| **Output Filter**    | Expand tone or safety rule sets |
| **Drift Detection**  | New logging patterns or visual analytics |
| **Integrations**     | Wrapper code for new APIs or CLI tools |
| **Docs & Examples**  | Use case walkthroughs, testing notebooks, or user flows |

## Branching Structure

- `main`: Stable, validated versions only  
- `dev`: Active module work (open PRs here)  
- `experimental`: Concept testing, non-canonical logic  

All major contributions should branch from `dev`.

## PR Checklist

- [ ] Code modular and documented  
- [ ] No core model retraining introduced  
- [ ] Logs structured, minimal exposure  
- [ ] Passes all system scan checks (manual or auto)  
- [ ] Includes test interaction example or demo run  

---

## Feedback Culture

- Feedback is structural, not personal  
- Every critique must include a suggested improvement or question  
- Use issues for exploratory ideas or design discussions — not just bugs

---

## Future Contribution Paths

- Tone translation modules for multilingual use  
- Visual signal maps and drift dashboards  
- Biometric or time-based session adjustment  
- External plugin layer for real-time assistant models (e.g., RAG or agents)
