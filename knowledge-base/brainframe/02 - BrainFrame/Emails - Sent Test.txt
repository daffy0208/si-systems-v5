Stel,

I really need to get back to the customer with something positive. Any chance you can get this sorted soon, as the customer is getting pretty desperate.

Much appreciated,

Stel,

 

I have the quote for the Keele University Aps now. Can you help me understand what they can get for swapping out 12 x AP-585 aps?

Based on Mat Bailey’s request, Keele University is looking to achieve the following:

 

Objectives:

1.	Swap Access Points

	*	Exchange 12x AP-585 units for AP-587 models.
	*	Ensure the best possible swap ratio (likely considering value or stock availability).
	*	All AP-585 units are unused and still boxed, which may facilitate the swap.

 

Thanks,

 

 

David Dunlop

Lee,

Thanks for sharing this. Obviously very disappointed with this decision as we have worked very hard with the network team until this point to help and to understand the Universities strategies and goals. 

We would like to still be involved on some level if that was possible even it means subcontracting, however I and Qolcom Bechtle wish you and the network team the best success in this project moving forward.

Regards,

David Dunlop

Hi David, 

I've received a message from our procurement team, there's an issue with In-tend, and they are raising a ticket. Please see below:

Dear Bidder,
 
Thank you for your interest in the recently issued RFI exercise, the University had significant interest in this exercise. After careful consideration, we regret to inform you that we will not be inviting your company to participate in a subsequent RFP exercise for Network Equipment and Services. I would like to thank you for your interest in the contract, the University recognises, and appreciates, the time and effort taken by suppliers in responding to University of Manchester opportunities and hope that your lack of success in this instance will not deter you from expressing an interest in any future opportunities
 
Kind Regards
Central Procurement Office

Kind regards

Hi Ben,

 

I've been passed your name as somebody to talk to around the monitoring and management for some networking equipment.

 

I'm working on some indicative pricing for a customer with several distilleries throughout Scotland. 

 

In total there are-

 

Switches: 66

WAPs: 221

 

All Aruba however customer has not provided models

 

There are also 2 Sophos UTM Firewalls, on all sites- with the exception of one of the small distilleries that has just 1 

 

Eric Lindsey suggested that I run the opportunity through you guys to see if there would be an appetite for it?

Jennifer,

Thank you for inviting us to submit our quotation for Cumberland Council’s Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal.

Please find attached the following documents:

1.	Cisco Equipment EOL Status & Recommendations
2.	Itemized Pricing Breakdown for Cisco Support Renewal

Support Term:

*	Confirming support coverage from 01/04/2025 to 31/03/2026.

Clarifications as Requested:

*	EOL Component Coverage: 

	*	Cisco generally does not guarantee like-for-like replacements for components in equipment marked as End-of-Life. Availability for replacements is limited or not guaranteed. Proactive replacement planning is recommended.

Definitions:

*	End-of-Life (EOL) Equipment:
	Equipment no longer actively supported or sold by Cisco; no software updates, security patches, or guaranteed hardware replacements after the stated End-of-Support date.
*	Breakfix Services:
	Support services providing reactive maintenance, including hardware replacements or repairs, based on your chosen Service Level Agreement (Premium – 24x7x4 or Enhanced – 8x5xNBD).
*	CCO Account Association:
	Cumberland Council’s Cisco Customer Connection Online (CCO) account will be associated with this renewal, ensuring continued software access and updates.

Recommendations & Additional Considerations:

*	Consider immediate replacement of EOL equipment (Catalyst 3850 switches, UCS B200 M4 blades, and UCS chassis).
*	Evaluate multi-year support agreements for sustained cost savings.
*	Qolcom is available to support Cumberland Council in planning a phased, strategic approach for hardware replacements and infrastructure upgrades.

Please let me know if you require further clarification or details.

Regards,

 

David Dunlop

Hi David,

 

There’s something still not right with the list – unless it’s how it’s rendering on my laptop. Can we perhaps jump on a quick call so I can show you what I mean?

Hi David,

 

Can you advise on the information below please so we can make a decision?

 

We have had a look at the quote (attached) and there is an issue with the spreadsheet in that some of the device descriptions in columns C and F don’t match and this affects the support level. Eg  see below

 



 

The C1113 router isa branch router but on the same line and you have costed this against a data centre access switch on Premium support (24x7) but we’d only need 8x5 as we’d asked for on the C1113. We think you have just got some of the columns mismatching. There’s a few others too in the list with mismatches the same. Can you rectify and resend to us so that device names match in columns C and F and then it’s clear what the support level is for the device? Thank you.

 

Kind Regards, Jennifer

Andrew,

Of course, that would be good. I'm out on the road at the moment so probably tomorrow would be best if that's ok?

Thanks,

Hi David,

 

There’s something still not right with the list – unless it’s how it’s rendering on my laptop. Can we perhaps jump on a quick call so I can show you what I mean?

Hi David,

 

Can you advise on the information below please so we can make a decision?

 

We have had a look at the quote (attached) and there is an issue with the spreadsheet in that some of the device descriptions in columns C and F don’t match and this affects the support level. Eg  see below

 



 

The C1113 router isa branch router but on the same line and you have costed this against a data centre access switch on Premium support (24x7) but we’d only need 8x5 as we’d asked for on the C1113. We think you have just got some of the columns mismatching. There’s a few others too in the list with mismatches the same. Can you rectify and resend to us so that device names match in columns C and F and then it’s clear what the support level is for the device? Thank you.

 

Kind Regards, Jennifer

Subject: RE: Request for Quote - Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal (** REVISED LIST **)

 

Jennifer,

Thank you for inviting us to submit our quotation for Cumberland Council’s Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal.

Please find attached the following documents:

1.	Cisco Equipment EOL Status & Recommendations
2.	Itemized Pricing Breakdown for Cisco Support Renewal

Support Term:

*	Confirming support coverage from 01/04/2025 to 31/03/2026.

Clarifications as Requested:

*	EOL Component Coverage: 

	*	Cisco generally does not guarantee like-for-like replacements for components in equipment marked as End-of-Life. Availability for replacements is limited or not guaranteed. Proactive replacement planning is recommended.

Definitions:

*	End-of-Life (EOL) Equipment:
	Equipment no longer actively supported or sold by Cisco; no software updates, security patches, or guaranteed hardware replacements after the stated End-of-Support date.
*	Breakfix Services:
	Support services providing reactive maintenance, including hardware replacements or repairs, based on your chosen Service Level Agreement (Premium – 24x7x4 or Enhanced – 8x5xNBD).
*	CCO Account Association:
	Cumberland Council’s Cisco Customer Connection Online (CCO) account will be associated with this renewal, ensuring continued software access and updates.

Recommendations & Additional Considerations:

*	Consider immediate replacement of EOL equipment (Catalyst 3850 switches, UCS B200 M4 blades, and UCS chassis).
*	Evaluate multi-year support agreements for sustained cost savings.
*	Qolcom is available to support Cumberland Council in planning a phased, strategic approach for hardware replacements and infrastructure upgrades.

Please let me know if you require further clarification or details.

Regards,

 

David Dunlop

Michael, Niamh,

 

I need some assistance from you guys if possible. ??

Cumberland got back to me to say that there were a few columns in our quote were out of alignment with the respective part numbers, so I spent a bit of time yesterday going through everything line by line (106 lines ??), and they have come back saying there is still something not quite right and can we get on a call. Before I arrange a call with them, I would appreciate if someone could go through it with me today and see where I am going wrong? I am not familiar with the Cisco kit as much as the Aruba so would be best if someone with better knowledge could assist.

 

P.S. It looks very positive in terms of price as they probably wouldn’t have come back to us twice. ??

 

Thanks,

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) not available yet

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) not available yet

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) not available yet

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors all plans reissued

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan roof plans of existing block attached

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) no basement, see attached cross section. I have also reissued the plans including the roof plan

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

Tim,

 

 

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) not available yet

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) not available yet

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) not available yet

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors all plans reissued

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan roof plans of existing block attached

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) no basement, see attached cross section. I have also reissued the plans including the roof plan

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

Tim,

 

 

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) not available yet

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) not available yet

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) not available yet

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors all plans reissued

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan roof plans of existing block attached

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) no basement, see attached cross section. I have also reissued the plans including the roof plan

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

Colin,

 

It’s ok I won’t mention it . . . I’ll focus on work. ??

 

So, I have had a look and, here are some basics before I get some quotes.

 

 

Available Options & Key Considerations

Option

Details

Considerations

Ekahau Sidekick 2

A dedicated mobile solution for Wi-Fi site surveys

? Ideal for mobile use, accurate and efficient 

? Self-calibrating for precise RF measurements 

? Higher upfront cost compared to using a laptop

Ekahau Connect Subscription

Required if using Sidekick 2 with iOS/Android apps

? Enables use with Ekahau Survey App (iOS/Android) 

? Includes Ekahau Cloud, Analyzer, and Sidekick support 

? Subscription-based cost (1, 3, or 5 years)

Laptop/Tablet + Existing Ekahau Pro

Use a new device to run their existing Ekahau Pro software

? Lower cost if they already have a license 

? Flexibility to choose any hardware 

? Less portable than Sidekick 2 

? May require manual calibration for accuracy

 

I’ll get a quote for each of the options. Have I understood you correctly?

Let me know your thoughts.

 

Ta,

Hi David,

 

As we get our ekahau pro support via yourselves, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible.

 

We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.

 

Thanks,

Colin

Hi David,

 

Can you advise on the information below please so we can make a decision?

 

We have had a look at the quote (attached) and there is an issue with the spreadsheet in that some of the device descriptions in columns C and F don’t match and this affects the support level. Eg  see below

 



 

The C1113 router isa branch router but on the same line and you have costed this against a data centre access switch on Premium support (24x7) but we’d only need 8x5 as we’d asked for on the C1113. We think you have just got some of the columns mismatching. There’s a few others too in the list with mismatches the same. Can you rectify and resend to us so that device names match in columns C and F and then it’s clear what the support level is for the device? Thank you.

 

Kind Regards, Jennifer

Subject: RE: Request for Quote - Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal (** REVISED LIST **)

 

Jennifer,

Thank you for inviting us to submit our quotation for Cumberland Council’s Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal.

Please find attached the following documents:

1.	Cisco Equipment EOL Status & Recommendations
2.	Itemized Pricing Breakdown for Cisco Support Renewal

Support Term:

*	Confirming support coverage from 01/04/2025 to 31/03/2026.

Clarifications as Requested:

*	EOL Component Coverage: 

	*	Cisco generally does not guarantee like-for-like replacements for components in equipment marked as End-of-Life. Availability for replacements is limited or not guaranteed. Proactive replacement planning is recommended.

Definitions:

*	End-of-Life (EOL) Equipment:
	Equipment no longer actively supported or sold by Cisco; no software updates, security patches, or guaranteed hardware replacements after the stated End-of-Support date.
*	Breakfix Services:
	Support services providing reactive maintenance, including hardware replacements or repairs, based on your chosen Service Level Agreement (Premium – 24x7x4 or Enhanced – 8x5xNBD).
*	CCO Account Association:
	Cumberland Council’s Cisco Customer Connection Online (CCO) account will be associated with this renewal, ensuring continued software access and updates.

Recommendations & Additional Considerations:

*	Consider immediate replacement of EOL equipment (Catalyst 3850 switches, UCS B200 M4 blades, and UCS chassis).
*	Evaluate multi-year support agreements for sustained cost savings.
*	Qolcom is available to support Cumberland Council in planning a phased, strategic approach for hardware replacements and infrastructure upgrades.

Please let me know if you require further clarification or details.

Regards,

Subject:	Qolcom - Northumbria University MS Team Set Up

Kevin,

 

Further to our conversation about setting up MS Teams for collaboration in all our projects, I have spoken to our IT Manager, Ben Hay who is looking to get this set up for us. 

 

With the work we’re doing across EVPN multi-fabric, automation, and long-term network strategy, we see Cross-Tenant Access as a way to simplify engagement and collaboration between our teams, this will help immensely with sharing resources and working across Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft 365 services. To support this, we have now configured Cross-Tenant Access on our side within Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) and wanted to check whether Northumbria University would be able to implement the required setup at your end as well. Enabling this would allow users from both organisations to collaborate more efficiently without requiring guest accounts, ensuring a smoother, more integrated experience. 

 

Would you be able to check internally whether this can be enabled at your side? If needed, we’re happy to share further details or coordinate with your IT team to facilitate the setup.

Let me know your thoughts.

Regards,

 

 

David Dunlop

We'll obviously catch up at some point but thought I'd send you Kevin's email ....

The guys were extremely complimentary about Simon and Joe's knowledge and in awe of Simon's designs and accompanying spreadsheets.

In short ... there's still a lot to do, but it went very well and a happy customer.

Hi Alex, David, Joe, Simon, Graham 

 

Just wanted to say a big thanks for presentations over the last couple of days , we all found it very useful. I hope everyone was able to catch the train in time. 

 

It certainly gives us some design considerations for the current design and for an idea on the steps required for features such as micro segmentation in the future. Useful to hear that we have a roadmap to that with the current design. 

 

Any slides & presentations that can be shared will be useful for the team & heads up on any new material from yourself @Neville, Joe <mailto:joe.neville@hpe.com>  especially around troubleshooting would be great help. 

 

I will catchup with @David Dunlop <mailto:ddunlop@qolcom.co.uk>  to discuss getting a Central setup to test on a few of 6300M switches , to start exploring the features.

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Hi Andy,

 

Any joy with this I'm getting a bit of flack from the customer. Anything you can do is much appreciated.

 

Just a thought ... is there anything we can do with eval licenses in the meantime? If so would this cause any issues when the licenses finally arrive?

 

Thanks,

 

David

Hi,

 

How’s it going at Northumbria?

 

According to Neil Matcham Alex Goffe from Manchester and Somebody from Durham (not James) are being hosted on the Juniper table tonight. We didn’t even know there were tables that we could host people on!!!

 

Neil Matcham says they are doing a full building POC with Manchester. 

 

I’ll let you tell Mike Sharwin ??

Hi David,

 

This is Durham’s Aruba renewal. I have priced the Central licenses the same as last year but the PBS is slightly cheaper this year.

 

The Central doesn’t expire until July but the PBS expires at the end of this month. I’m not sure how you quoted to the customer last year and if the price needs to match or not…

 

Let me know ??

 

Thanks,

I haven’t seen a PO for this. All is saw was a PO for this:

 

Wireless Survey to validate the previously provided Desktop Planning. Engineer will attend site to carry out spot checks to confirm expected coverage from previously designed WAP locations. A number of locations will be tested on the Ground and First Floors with the results being used to confirm the overall design. It is understood that the Second Floor is currently not in a state of readiness for the survey. Any areas not in a final state of construction may not provide accurate results however every effort will be made to confirm full coverage from the final results. These results will be shared in the form of a survey report and where required revised AP planning will be provided.  

Includes for one day on site testing (including induction where necessary), travel and accommodation.

Work to be carried out during Normal Working Hours.

 

We did this back in November. Is the Post install survey a new order?

 

Thanks

Hi,

 

I believe that Aveda ordered the above but to date Qolcom have not received a request for this work to go ahead, as all the WAP’s have now been installed we need to get this commissioned, as you are aware the move in date is fast approaching so it really needs doing ASAP

Hi,

 

I believe that Aveda ordered the above but to date Qolcom have not received a request for this work to go ahead, as all the WAP’s have now been installed we need to get this commissioned, as you are aware the move in date is fast approaching so it really needs doing ASAP

Stel,

 

I have the quote for the Keele University Aps now. Can you help me understand what they can get for swapping out 12 x AP-585 aps?

Based on Mat Bailey’s request, Keele University is looking to achieve the following:

 

Objectives:

1.	Swap Access Points

	*	Exchange 12x AP-585 units for AP-587 models.
	*	Ensure the best possible swap ratio (likely considering value or stock availability).
	*	All AP-585 units are unused and still boxed, which may facilitate the swap.

 

Thanks,

Hi David,

 

Can you advise on the information below please so we can make a decision?

 

We have had a look at the quote (attached) and there is an issue with the spreadsheet in that some of the device descriptions in columns C and F don’t match and this affects the support level. Eg  see below

 



 

The C1113 router isa branch router but on the same line and you have costed this against a data centre access switch on Premium support (24x7) but we’d only need 8x5 as we’d asked for on the C1113. We think you have just got some of the columns mismatching. There’s a few others too in the list with mismatches the same. Can you rectify and resend to us so that device names match in columns C and F and then it’s clear what the support level is for the device? Thank you.

 

Kind Regards, Jennifer

Jennifer,

Thank you for inviting us to submit our quotation for Cumberland Council’s Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal.

Please find attached the following documents:

1.	Cisco Equipment EOL Status & Recommendations
2.	Itemized Pricing Breakdown for Cisco Support Renewal

Support Term:

*	Confirming support coverage from 01/04/2025 to 31/03/2026.

Clarifications as Requested:

*	EOL Component Coverage: 

	*	Cisco generally does not guarantee like-for-like replacements for components in equipment marked as End-of-Life. Availability for replacements is limited or not guaranteed. Proactive replacement planning is recommended.

Definitions:

*	End-of-Life (EOL) Equipment:
	Equipment no longer actively supported or sold by Cisco; no software updates, security patches, or guaranteed hardware replacements after the stated End-of-Support date.
*	Breakfix Services:
	Support services providing reactive maintenance, including hardware replacements or repairs, based on your chosen Service Level Agreement (Premium – 24x7x4 or Enhanced – 8x5xNBD).
*	CCO Account Association:
	Cumberland Council’s Cisco Customer Connection Online (CCO) account will be associated with this renewal, ensuring continued software access and updates.

Recommendations & Additional Considerations:

*	Consider immediate replacement of EOL equipment (Catalyst 3850 switches, UCS B200 M4 blades, and UCS chassis).
*	Evaluate multi-year support agreements for sustained cost savings.
*	Qolcom is available to support Cumberland Council in planning a phased, strategic approach for hardware replacements and infrastructure upgrades.

Please let me know if you require further clarification or details.

Regards,

 

David Dunlop

Hi David,

 

Yes. Looks like Sidekick2 and ekahau connect subscription (1/3/5years) cost options required.

 

Thanks,

Colin

Colin,

 

It’s ok I won’t mention it . . . I’ll focus on work. ??

 

So, I have had a look and, here are some basics before I get some quotes.

 

 

Available Options & Key Considerations

Option

Details

Considerations

Ekahau Sidekick 2

A dedicated mobile solution for Wi-Fi site surveys

? Ideal for mobile use, accurate and efficient 

? Self-calibrating for precise RF measurements 

? Higher upfront cost compared to using a laptop

Ekahau Connect Subscription

Required if using Sidekick 2 with iOS/Android apps

? Enables use with Ekahau Survey App (iOS/Android) 

? Includes Ekahau Cloud, Analyzer, and Sidekick support 

? Subscription-based cost (1, 3, or 5 years)

Laptop/Tablet + Existing Ekahau Pro

Use a new device to run their existing Ekahau Pro software

? Lower cost if they already have a license 

? Flexibility to choose any hardware 

? Less portable than Sidekick 2 

? May require manual calibration for accuracy

 

I’ll get a quote for each of the options. Have I understood you correctly?

Let me know your thoughts.

 

Ta,

Hi David,

 

As we get our ekahau pro support via yourselves, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible.

 

We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.

 

Thanks,

Colin

Hi David, 

 

Please fine quote attached.

 

Please note as this is an additional license, the client will need to purchase the Software (ESS-PRO-SW2-NEW) along with the Connect Subscription.

 

There is not a 5-year option for Subs.

Yes, this is in addition to their renewal from January. Below is what Colin sent to me . . .

Happy to help with a quote, I just need to check is this for an additional license for University of Aberdeen or renewal of existing license?

Michael,

 

Thanks for getting back to me and nice to meet you too. ??

 

Yes, this is in addition to their renewal from January. Below is what Colin sent to me . . .

 

“Hi David, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible. We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.”

 

I have replied to Colin with the options, so hopefully that all makes sense.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

Hi David, 

 

I hope you are well. 

 

I have picked this up from Craig as I look after Qolcom at Open Relaity. Nice to e-meet you.

 

Happy to help with a quote, I just need to check is this for an additional license for University of Aberdeen or renewal of existing license?

 

They renewed their existing license in January this year (PO-14662).

Hi David,

 

Yes. Looks like Sidekick2 and ekahau connect subscription (1/3/5years) cost options required.

 

Thanks,

Colin,

 

It’s ok I won’t mention it . . . I’ll focus on work. ??

 

So, I have had a look and, here are some basics before I get some quotes.

 

 

Available Options & Key Considerations

Option

Details

Considerations

Ekahau Sidekick 2

A dedicated mobile solution for Wi-Fi site surveys

? Ideal for mobile use, accurate and efficient 

? Self-calibrating for precise RF measurements 

? Higher upfront cost compared to using a laptop

Ekahau Connect Subscription

Required if using Sidekick 2 with iOS/Android apps

? Enables use with Ekahau Survey App (iOS/Android) 

? Includes Ekahau Cloud, Analyzer, and Sidekick support 

? Subscription-based cost (1, 3, or 5 years)

Laptop/Tablet + Existing Ekahau Pro

Use a new device to run their existing Ekahau Pro software

? Lower cost if they already have a license 

? Flexibility to choose any hardware 

? Less portable than Sidekick 2 

? May require manual calibration for accuracy

 

I’ll get a quote for each of the options. Have I understood you correctly?

Let me know your thoughts.

 

Ta,

Hi David,

 

As we get our ekahau pro support via yourselves, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible.

 

We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.

Tim,

Unfortunately, I need to head out early tonight to take the wee fella to football training, but I'm available all day tomorrow.

We've reviewed everything, although there are a few things we need to establish from the University, but I can go through that tomorrow.

Apologies for not being in touch sooner, just been very busy, but we'll get you sorted.

Thanks,

Tim,

 

 

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) not available yet

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) not available yet

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) not available yet

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors all plans reissued

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan roof plans of existing block attached

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) no basement, see attached cross section. I have also reissued the plans including the roof plan

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

Apologies for the delay in getting back to you. I will be back at my desk tomorrow. I did however pass this over to our operations department to review the plans etc so hopefully I'll have something over to you soon.

Thanks,

Any joy with this I'm getting a bit of flack from the customer. Anything you can do is much appreciated.

 

Just a thought ... is there anything we can do with eval licenses in the meantime? If so would this cause any issues when the licenses finally arrive?

Subject:	Qolcom - Possible approach to Cumberland

Jack,

As we discussed I have been putting a few things together, but I just want to give you the gist of what we are looking at. It is a bit different but for them I think there are compelling factors . . . and yes, the plan is to swap out all the kit with Aruba, so this plan allows you and me to get what we want and simplifies things for the council.

The Essence of Our Idea

With the merger and everything Cumberland is dealing with, IT is obviously a big part of making sure things don’t become overly complicated. Right now, they’re juggling:

*	Four different councils’ IT infrastructures, teams, and vendor contracts.
*	A mix of procurement models and legacy systems that don’t necessarily align.
*	An opportunity to consolidate, streamline, and make IT work for the future, rather than just patching together what’s already there.

We’re not trying to tell them how to do it or push a solution—far from it. But we do think that our model at Qolcom and Bechtle gives them a way to approach this that avoids some of the usual pain points and internal struggles that come with mergers. Rather than going down the road of multiple vendors battling it out and internal teams having to fight over decisions, we think we can help them put a structure in place that ensures stability, flexibility, and a clear long-term plan without getting stuck in politics and procurement delays.

Why We Think This Works for Cumberland

Instead of them having to deal with:

*	Multiple vendors pushing competing solutions
*	Procurement battles over who supplies what
*	Short-term fixes rather than a proper strategy

We’d be offering:

*	One strategic IT framework that aligns with their long-term goals
*	A procurement model that leverages Bechtle’s catalogue for consistency across infrastructure, security, and end-user computing (including the HP laptops they already buy)
*	A way to standardize IT planning without forcing vendor lock-in—so they have a clear direction but still have flexibility where they need it
*	A structure that allows them to focus on service delivery and transformation rather than firefighting IT decisions

This isn’t just about networking or security—it’s how they manage IT as a whole. With Bechtle’s procurement model and Qolcom’s experience with their networking and security infrastructure, we can give them a simple, unified way to manage IT across the new council—without disrupting what’s already working.

How We See This Playing Out

The way we’re looking at this is not about making them rip anything out or forcing changes (Yet ??). It’s about:

*	Stabilizing what they have – Making sure their infrastructure remains strong while they figure out the best long-term path.
*	Creating a procurement and support framework – So they don’t have to keep revisiting the same IT decisions repeatedly.
*	Giving them flexibility for the future – Ensuring they can adapt without being locked into solutions that don’t fit their evolving needs.

This should make life easier for their IT teams, reduce unnecessary procurement battles, and allow leadership to focus on delivering services rather than dealing with IT admin headaches. You’ve been working with Cumberland for a while and they have been a customer of mine for 16 years. I think the timing of their merger and the Qolcom | Bechtle thing gives “us” and edge

Let me know your thoughts.

Ian,

I was supposed to finalise a room for the HPE Aruba road map update on 17th March, but I see he is on holiday this week. Any chance one of you guys can assist in getting a room booked for next Monday? Myself and Simon will be there on the Tuesday 18th as well for the multi-fabric meeting also.

 

Anything you guys can do is much appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Hi Andrew,

 

Apologise for the late response, thanks for getting back to me and booking out Ben from 21st April. 

 

Look forward to receiving the HLD, I’ve extended the room on the 18th to enable us to review the HLD. 

 

See you at the kick-off / design workshop and seeing a SOW and detailed delivery plan.   

 

Thanks Ian

Hi Ian, 

 

We held a meeting in February and we are aware of your May 31st deadline.

 

I spoke to Simon, he is working on your HLD which he hopes to complete by end of play Friday 14th March.  He will get that over to you for review shortly after.  

 

Simon is onsite with Northumbria University staff, for a meeting with HPE on the 18th March, if you could book out a room from about 12 for a working lunch, he will be able to run you through the HLD.  Please be aware he has a 6-hour drive home after that meeting so time will be a little restrictive.

 

Once the HLD is agreed, the next step is to have a kickoff meeting or design workshop with Ben Richards, from which he can create an LLD or SOW before commencing work.

 

We mentioned on the call, but you will not be aware, Qolcom have a large 4 week All hands engagement starting next week, involving all our engineers who will be out of the country, largely without internet access.

 

That said, you will see I have blocked Ben’s calendar out from 21 April through 31 May.  The work won’t take that long and I can refine his time down as we get closer, but it prevents him being assigned to other projects until we iron out our timeline.

 

Regards

Hi Andrew,

 

Thank you for reaching out and as your probably aware I’m keen to getting moving on this given that we have a deadline of 31st May to complete. Can you schedule a kick-off for w/c 17th March, that is giving two weeks to enable Simon to complete the HLD/LLD.

 

Any queries or concerns, please don’t hesitate in contacting me.

 

Thanks & regards

Thanks Kevin.

 

Just as a note, I am currently updating the original HLD document which I produced for City Campus to reflect all of the changes that have either happened or been agreed since then. The document will take into consideration the work that has been completed to date, reference the testing carried out recently and provide a baseline  for us to take forward into the design workshop(s), the production of a revised LLD and then into the implementation and testing phases.

 

There is quite a bit of material that needs to be worked into this document plus changes to the original content so I am going to need a week or so to get it to a place I am comfortable with. 

 

As soon as it is ready I will review it with the team here and get it published to you.

 

Thanks,

Simon

Ian,

I was supposed to finalise a room for the HPE Aruba road map update on 17th March, but I see he is on holiday this week. Any chance one of you guys can assist in getting a room booked for next Monday? Myself and Simon will be there on the Tuesday 18th as well for the multi-fabric meeting also.

 

Anything you guys can do is much appreciated.

We held a meeting in February and we are aware of your May 31st deadline.

 

I spoke to Simon, he is working on your HLD which he hopes to complete by end of play Friday 14th March.  He will get that over to you for review shortly after.  

 

Simon is onsite with Northumbria University staff, for a meeting with HPE on the 18th March, if you could book out a room from about 12 for a working lunch, he will be able to run you through the HLD.  Please be aware he has a 6-hour drive home after that meeting so time will be a little restrictive.

 

Once the HLD is agreed, the next step is to have a kickoff meeting or design workshop with Ben Richards, from which he can create an LLD or SOW before commencing work.

 

We mentioned on the call, but you will not be aware, Qolcom have a large 4 week All hands engagement starting next week, involving all our engineers who will be out of the country, largely without internet access.

 

That said, you will see I have blocked Ben’s calendar out from 21 April through 31 May.  The work won’t take that long and I can refine his time down as we get closer, but it prevents him being assigned to other projects until we iron out our timeline.

Hi Andrew,

 

Thank you for reaching out and as your probably aware I’m keen to getting moving on this given that we have a deadline of 31st May to complete. Can you schedule a kick-off for w/c 17th March, that is giving two weeks to enable Simon to complete the HLD/LLD.

 

Any queries or concerns, please don’t hesitate in contacting me.

 

Thanks & regards

Thanks Kevin.

 

Just as a note, I am currently updating the original HLD document which I produced for City Campus to reflect all of the changes that have either happened or been agreed since then. The document will take into consideration the work that has been completed to date, reference the testing carried out recently and provide a baseline  for us to take forward into the design workshop(s), the production of a revised LLD and then into the implementation and testing phases.

 

There is quite a bit of material that needs to be worked into this document plus changes to the original content so I am going to need a week or so to get it to a place I am comfortable with. 

 

As soon as it is ready I will review it with the team here and get it published to you.

 

Thanks,

Simon

Ian,

I was supposed to finalise a room for the HPE Aruba road map update on 17th March, but I see he is on holiday this week. Any chance one of you guys can assist in getting a room booked for next Monday? Myself and Simon will be there on the Tuesday 18th as well for the multi-fabric meeting also.

 

Anything you guys can do is much appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Apologise for the late response, thanks for getting back to me and booking out Ben from 21st April. 

 

Look forward to receiving the HLD, I’ve extended the room on the 18th to enable us to review the HLD. 

 

See you at the kick-off / design workshop and seeing a SOW and detailed delivery plan.

The document will take into consideration the work that has been completed to date, reference the testing carried out recently and provide a baseline  for us to take forward into the design workshop(s), the production of a revised LLD and then into the implementation and testing phases.

 

There is quite a bit of material that needs to be worked into this document plus changes to the original content so I am going to need a week or so to get it to a place I am comfortable with. 

 

As soon as it is ready I will review it with the team here and get it published to you.

 

Thanks,

Simon

Morning,

 

I think we can work in general terms. We know it’s 2700 APs. 

 

Out PS should cover:

 

*	AP integration (each AP becomes a connector and is associated with a space name)
*	Zoning (a collection of spaces)
*	Workflows – i.e. alerts for when items leave a zone, or become separated from their paired devices. 
*	Integration (Webhooks and APIs) – definitely some responsibility from them on this regarding their systems and how they will integrate. 

 

To make sure we capture everything I would like to get Alan involved as he understands this. 

 

Can you set up a call between the three of us? Tomorrow afternoon or early next week?

 

Thanks,

 

Stuart.

Stuart,

 

Just so I have understood this correctly . . . Mat wants the scope of the PoC to be expand in terms of coverage to the full campus, so we would need to amend the scope and quote with ps for mapping the Aps? I assume there is a bit of thought that goes into the mapping in terms of locations/zones etc, so if I have understood that correctly, what do we need (if anything) from Mat to be able to cost this?

 

Thanks,

Hi David, 

 

Just re-read this email and understand the additional information. 

 

I think on the full rollout part, we assume the same number of tags for now. Where I'm trying to get to with that, is if we wanted to go campus wide for coverage reasons but not necessarily increase what we were covering to start with. 

 

I know that some of the medical kit for example, isn't going to go in the student accommodation, but they keys might, so I think that's going to be the next logical step for the project before we start to look at adding additional things to locate/track.

 

Thanks for getting this together,

Mat

Hi David, 

 

Thanks for sending this over. I will pass it on to the team for consideration. 

 

Is this for 100 tags with a max subscription of 500?

 

I think one other question will be around on-going costs:

Could we get an understanding of ongoing costs yearly, lets say if we continued with the current PoC and we expanded the system to cover all of our access points (Approx 2700) with the proposed number of tags.

 

Thanks,

Mat

Hi Mat,

 

Please find attached the quote (QUO-17351) for the Blyott Proof of Concept (PoC) at Keele University. This initial quote is based on a three-month PoC, but we can adjust the term to 6, 9, or 12 months depending on your preference. Let me know what works best for you, and I’ll get updated pricing over to you.

 

To summarise, the PoC will provide tracking capabilities for keys, medical assets, and high-value library books, utilizing 1,000 Aruba AOS10.7.x access points to ensure comprehensive campus coverage. It also includes WebHooks & REST APIs, which could support workflow automation and potential integration with Qolcom Vision if needed.

 

If you have any questions or need any modifications, let me know, and I’ll be happy to assist.

 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

 

Best regards,

David Dunlop

Jennifer,

Thank you for inviting us to submit our quotation for Cumberland Council’s Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal.

Please find attached the following documents:

1.	Cisco Equipment EOL Status & Recommendations
2.	Itemized Pricing Breakdown for Cisco Support Renewal

Support Term:

*	Confirming support coverage from 01/04/2025 to 31/03/2026.

Clarifications as Requested:

*	EOL Component Coverage: 

	*	Cisco generally does not guarantee like-for-like replacements for components in equipment marked as End-of-Life. Availability for replacements is limited or not guaranteed. Proactive replacement planning is recommended.

Definitions:

*	End-of-Life (EOL) Equipment:
	Equipment no longer actively supported or sold by Cisco; no software updates, security patches, or guaranteed hardware replacements after the stated End-of-Support date.
*	Breakfix Services:
	Support services providing reactive maintenance, including hardware replacements or repairs, based on your chosen Service Level Agreement (Premium – 24x7x4 or Enhanced – 8x5xNBD).
*	CCO Account Association:
	Cumberland Council’s Cisco Customer Connection Online (CCO) account will be associated with this renewal, ensuring continued software access and updates.

Recommendations & Additional Considerations:

*	Consider immediate replacement of EOL equipment (Catalyst 3850 switches, UCS B200 M4 blades, and UCS chassis).
*	Evaluate multi-year support agreements for sustained cost savings.
*	Qolcom is available to support Cumberland Council in planning a phased, strategic approach for hardware replacements and infrastructure upgrades.

Please let me know if you require further clarification or details.

Regards,

 

David Dunlop

Bechtle and Qolcom Acquisition Update

Dear Stuart
 
On Monday 7th October 2024, it was announced that Bechtle Limited are acquiring Qolcom.
 
So, as a Qolcom customer, what does this mean for you? We have summarised what will be happening, and when, to ensure you are kept up to date every step of the way.

 

 

 

We will consult with you all the way to ensure a smooth transition. Your key contacts will remain the same. You can be certain that the outstanding service levels you are used to receiving from Qolcom will continue uninterrupted.
 
From 1st March 2025 until the second half of 2026 (date tbc), Qolcom will begin a soft rebrand in collaboration with Bechtle. This means that you will begin to see the wording "Qolcom | Bechtle Group" and the Bechtle Group logo appearing alongside the Qolcom logo. 
 
IMPORTANT: Qolcom will continue to exist as a legally independent company until the merger is complete, and thus also remain the contractual partner for all active contracts.

IMPORTANT CHANGES

What’s changing from 1st March 2025?

What's NOT changing until 2026?

 

*	Company name - Qolcom will become  'Qolcom | Bechtle Group'       
*	Bechtle logo on the Qolcom website
*	Marketing documents will be adjusted to incorporate the new name
*	In 2026, contact e-mail addresses will be updated to follow the Bechtle format (firstname.lastname@bechtle.com <mailto:firstname.lastname@bechtle.com> ) - Qolcom email addresses will still work  

 

*	Legal merger
*	Commercial Register no.
*	Tax no.
*	Bank account holder name
*	Agreements - will migrate 1 for 1
*	Invoices

 



New legal entity from 2026
Over the coming months, we will take steps towards the legal merger of Qolcom into Bechtle Limited, which will become effective in 2026, the official date is to be confirmed. 
We will keep you up to date with how this will work with purchase orders and other documentation.
 
Our Newbury office co-workers will continue to work from the Newbury address as usual, there are no plans for this to change. For you as a customer it will be business as usual.

What's new?
 
Additional support and resources
With this exciting new development for the team, the move also means an increased benefit for you, our customers. As well as offices across 14 countries in Europe, plus an International partnership with the help of their Global IT Alliance, Bechtle Limited. already have 4 UK based offices, with the HQ in Chippenham, a secondary office in Manchester, plus the addition of our Northampton office following the acquisition of ACS Office Solutions, and our London office following the acquisition of Tangible Benefit.

Stuart,

 

Just so I have understood this correctly . . . Mat wants the scope of the PoC to be expand in terms of coverage to the full campus, so we would need to amend the scope and quote with ps for mapping the Aps? I assume there is a bit of thought that goes into the mapping in terms of locations/zones etc, so if I have understood that correctly, what do we need (if anything) from Mat to be able to cost this?

 

Thanks,

 

 

David Dunlop

Hi David, 

 

Just re-read this email and understand the additional information. 

 

I think on the full rollout part, we assume the same number of tags for now. Where I'm trying to get to with that, is if we wanted to go campus wide for coverage reasons but not necessarily increase what we were covering to start with. 

 

I know that some of the medical kit for example, isn't going to go in the student accommodation, but they keys might, so I think that's going to be the next logical step for the project before we start to look at adding additional things to locate/track.

 

Thanks for getting this together,

Mat

Hi David, 

 

Thanks for sending this over. I will pass it on to the team for consideration. 

 

Is this for 100 tags with a max subscription of 500?

 

I think one other question will be around on-going costs:

Could we get an understanding of ongoing costs yearly, lets say if we continued with the current PoC and we expanded the system to cover all of our access points (Approx 2700) with the proposed number of tags.

 

Thanks,

Mat

Hi Mat,

 

Please find attached the quote (QUO-17351) for the Blyott Proof of Concept (PoC) at Keele University. This initial quote is based on a three-month PoC, but we can adjust the term to 6, 9, or 12 months depending on your preference. Let me know what works best for you, and I’ll get updated pricing over to you.

 

To summarise, the PoC will provide tracking capabilities for keys, medical assets, and high-value library books, utilizing 1,000 Aruba AOS10.7.x access points to ensure comprehensive campus coverage. It also includes WebHooks & REST APIs, which could support workflow automation and potential integration with Qolcom Vision if needed.

 

If you have any questions or need any modifications, let me know, and I’ll be happy to assist.

 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

 

Best regards,

David Dunlop

Subject: Qolcom - Keele University - SFP Issue 

 

Mike, 

 

Mat has highlighted an issue with their J4858D SFPs. They’ve been troubleshooting low light levels on their fibre links and discovered they’ve got two versions of the transceivers under the same SKU:  

 

CN-prefixed - serials (e.g., CN06KC5NF6): These align with the expected 500m spec.  

MY-prefixed - serials (e.g., MY0BKBP5JT): These seem to max out at 300-330m.  

 

The fibre itself has been checked and is fine, so the shorter-range MY SFPs look to be the issue where installed.  

 

Any idea why there’s a difference between these two? Let me know if you've seen this before and what you think.

 

P.S. The order/quote for the kit in the tender for this SKU does specify 500m. I also had a Google regarding the serial numbers and apparently the prefix denotes the region of manufacture ... CN being China, and MY being Malaysia.

 

 

Cheers,

 

David

Hi David,

 

Our system ticket is: IN92755

Aruba System ticket is: 5387577330

 

I am not getting any response out of Aruba support team for further updates on this. Can you see if you can push from commercial end? We haven’t had any update from Aruba since 17th of Feb. 

 

Many thanks,

Jamie

Jamie, Pete,

 

As discussed yesterday, please see the email below from Mike Sharwin at HPE Aruba. The sfps with those serial numbers are a known issue and can be swapped out.

 

Please let me know if you need anything from me to assist with the RMA.

 

Cheers,

Mike, 

 

Mat has highlighted an issue with their J4858D SFPs. They’ve been troubleshooting low light levels on their fibre links and discovered they’ve got two versions of the transceivers under the same SKU:  

 

CN-prefixed - serials (e.g., CN06KC5NF6): These align with the expected 500m spec.  

MY-prefixed - serials (e.g., MY0BKBP5JT): These seem to max out at 300-330m.  

 

The fibre itself has been checked and is fine, so the shorter-range MY SFPs look to be the issue where installed.  

 

Any idea why there’s a difference between these two? Let me know if you've seen this before and what you think.

 

P.S. The order/quote for the kit in the tender for this SKU does specify 500m. I also had a Google regarding the serial numbers and apparently the prefix denotes the region of manufacture ... CN being China, and MY being Malaysia.

 

 

Cheers,

 

David

Kevin,

 

As discussed, please see below a link to the meeting notes, as I mentioned there is a doc with all the notes combined also.

 

 NU - Strategy & Design Meeting - Feb 2025 <https://qolcom-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ddunlop_qolcom_co_uk/EuN0mX2sadxIiPRL3qJwBtcBi6uqEj6YAh_3T3POZdUxGQ?e=YhEW7d> 

 

I have also attached a list of actions that were noted at the meeting. Please don’t get hung up on whose name is against each at the moment as I haven’t had a chance to check with yourself and Simon yet, but I am hoping that we can have some time either tomorrow or Friday to go through it so we can finalise the agenda for the meeting on 17th March. (And of course see if you can book a room. ??)

Stel,

 

I have the quote for the Keele University Aps now. Can you help me understand what they can get for swapping out 12 x AP-585 aps?

Based on Mat Bailey’s request, Keele University is looking to achieve the following:

 

Objectives:

1.	Swap Access Points

	*	Exchange 12x AP-585 units for AP-587 models.
	*	Ensure the best possible swap ratio (likely considering value or stock availability).
	*	All AP-585 units are unused and still boxed, which may facilitate the swap.

 

Thanks,

Funnily enough ... after you and I discussing the state of the world (but only after my Ronnie Corbett AI ramble ??) I came home after Carrick's football training to see the embarrassing shambles that is America.

So in a strange twist, this opportunity you shared was one of many things that was being discussed last night to distance Scotland from Trump and Musk.

Kier Starmer took a letter from the King to meet Trump in Scotland .... so this is a long running thing but Trump is hated in Scotland and has been for many years and many reasons. There is a huge campaign not just to stop the meeting in Scotland but to end deals like this one.

Having said that .... it's £500k. ??

I'll send you a pic on WhatsApp that is real and it is used by Scottish politicians.

Ben,

 

I have a quote request from Cumberland for Aruba and Cisco kit . . . Can we get a competitive quote for Cisco kit from Bechtle? This could end up a complete refresh of 4 councils that have merged . . . .

Hi David, 

 

Thanks for clarification.

 

I have attached a quote for the Ekahau Suite for you.

 

Depending on what they are trying to achieve they could need AI Pro and Connect as well as the Sidekick, but it’s not clear from Colin’s reply.

 

Happy to jump on a call if support is needed.

Michael,

 

Thanks for getting back to me and nice to meet you too. ??

 

Yes, this is in addition to their renewal from January. Below is what Colin sent to me . . .

 

“Hi David, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible. We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.”

 

I have replied to Colin with the options, so hopefully that all makes sense.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

Hi David, 

 

I hope you are well. 

 

I have picked this up from Craig as I look after Qolcom at Open Relaity. Nice to e-meet you.

 

Happy to help with a quote, I just need to check is this for an additional license for University of Aberdeen or renewal of existing license?

 

They renewed their existing license in January this year (PO-14662).

2.	Expanding Beyond 100 Tags (Within the 500-Tag License)

	*	You can add more tags (e.g., 200 total) without increasing their subscription license.
	*	You only need to buy additional physical tags (£13.90 per tag).
	*	Potential PS costs for mapping new APs.

3.	Full Rollout Across 2,700 APs

	*	What number of tags would Keele want in a full deployment?
	*	Additional Professional Services (PS) may be required for mapping new APs.

Hi David, 

 

Thanks for sending this over. I will pass it on to the team for consideration. 

 

Is this for 100 tags with a max subscription of 500?

 

I think one other question will be around on-going costs:

Could we get an understanding of ongoing costs yearly, lets say if we continued with the current PoC and we expanded the system to cover all of our access points (Approx 2700) with the proposed number of tags.

 

Thanks,

Mat

Hi Mat,

 

Please find attached the quote (QUO-17351) for the Blyott Proof of Concept (PoC) at Keele University. This initial quote is based on a three-month PoC, but we can adjust the term to 6, 9, or 12 months depending on your preference. Let me know what works best for you, and I’ll get updated pricing over to you.

 

To summarise, the PoC will provide tracking capabilities for keys, medical assets, and high-value library books, utilizing 1,000 Aruba AOS10.7.x access points to ensure comprehensive campus coverage. It also includes WebHooks & REST APIs, which could support workflow automation and potential integration with Qolcom Vision if needed.

 

If you have any questions or need any modifications, let me know, and I’ll be happy to assist.

 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

 

Best regards,

David Dunlop

Michael,

 

Thanks for getting back to me and nice to meet you too. ??

 

Yes, this is in addition to their renewal from January. Below is what Colin sent to me . . .

 

“Hi David, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible. We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.”

 

I have replied to Colin with the options, so hopefully that all makes sense.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

Hi David, 

 

I hope you are well. 

 

I have picked this up from Craig as I look after Qolcom at Open Relaity. Nice to e-meet you.

 

Happy to help with a quote, I just need to check is this for an additional license for University of Aberdeen or renewal of existing license?

 

They renewed their existing license in January this year (PO-14662).

Ben,

 

I have a quote request from Cumberland for Aruba and Cisco kit . . . Can we get a competitive quote for Cisco kit from Bechtle? This could end up a complete refresh of 4 councils that have merged . . . .

? Ensure competitive pricing, as the decision is price-based.
? Quote exact part numbers to match their requested equipment.
? Confirm delivery lead times (important for their office move).
? Mention validity period for the quote and expected PO issuance date.
? Clarify any licensing details to avoid misinterpretation.
? If any items are EOL (End-of-Life), suggest alternatives with justification.

 

Please let me know if this is something they can do.

Hi Mat,

 

Please find attached the quote (QUO-17351) for the Blyott Proof of Concept (PoC) at Keele University. This initial quote is based on a three-month PoC, but we can adjust the term to 6, 9, or 12 months depending on your preference. Let me know what works best for you, and I’ll get updated pricing over to you.

 

To summarise, the PoC will provide tracking capabilities for keys, medical assets, and high-value library books, utilizing 1,000 Aruba AOS10.7.x access points to ensure comprehensive campus coverage. It also includes WebHooks & REST APIs, which could support workflow automation and potential integration with Qolcom Vision if needed.

 

If you have any questions or need any modifications, let me know, and I’ll be happy to assist.

 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

 

Best regards,

David Dunlop

Hi Jennifer,

 

I hope you’re doing well.

 

Please find attached our quotation (QUO-17236) for the Aruba Support Renewal covering the period 20/03/2025 – 31/05/2026, as requested. This ensures alignment with your existing contract term.

 

The total quoted cost is £61,293.94 (Inc.

If you require any adjustments or further details, please don’t hesitate to reach out. We look forward to hearing from you and I’m happy to assist with any questions.

 

P.S. I’ll be following up shortly with a separate email to share some observations and possible recommendations based on your current infrastructure and ongoing digital transformation efforts. I hope this will be helpful as you move to the next phases of your ICT strategy.

 

Regards,

Hi Andrew, 

 

I messaged you the other week to see if we could get a catch up regarding the ClearPass project. We had a call earlier with Glen about things in general and we had a few questions, but he suggested catching up with yourself regarding the security/ClearPass project. Do you have any time for a call with myself and Mike Ashby? Just for an update and we can share what we've done so far.

Tim,

 

 

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) not available yet

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) not available yet

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) not available yet

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors all plans reissued

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan roof plans of existing block attached

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) no basement, see attached cross section. I have also reissued the plans including the roof plan

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

Tim,

 

 

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) 

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) 

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) 

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors 

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan 

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) 

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

Subject:	RE: Durham University, Aruba Support Renewal

Hi Eliska,

 

Apologies for not replying sooner but thank you for following up and for providing the renewal quotes. We really appreciate the effort in getting these options over to us.

 

I just wanted to clarify that while these quotes are certainly useful, they represent only a small part of Durham University's overall support renewal. While they might seem like straightforward renewal options, the situation is more complex, as their full renewal involves multiple elements that need to be considered together. We have a structured process for support renewals, ensuring that everything is reviewed as a whole and co-termed where appropriate. This helps maintain consistency, simplifies ongoing management for the customer, and ensures the best overall outcome. That process is already in place, and we are currently working on finalising the full support renewal quote for Durham University.

 

Their renewal date remains April 1st, so we are actively working towards providing them with a comprehensive and aligned proposal.

 

I will let you know how we get on.

 

Best regards,
 

David Dunlop

I probably should have cc'd you also. I will catch up with Mike and Stuart, but happy to arrange a call for you Mike and Stuart to discuss it.

Let me know your thoughts.

I'm keen to get it nailed down soon given that we have almost 50 floor plans currently for planning for about 1,500 bedrooms.

Colin,

 

It’s ok I won’t mention it . . . I’ll focus on work. ??

 

So, I have had a look and, here are some basics before I get some quotes.

 

 

Available Options & Key Considerations

Option

Details

Considerations

Ekahau Sidekick 2

A dedicated mobile solution for Wi-Fi site surveys

? Ideal for mobile use, accurate and efficient 

? Self-calibrating for precise RF measurements 

? Higher upfront cost compared to using a laptop

Ekahau Connect Subscription

Required if using Sidekick 2 with iOS/Android apps

? Enables use with Ekahau Survey App (iOS/Android) 

? Includes Ekahau Cloud, Analyzer, and Sidekick support 

? Subscription-based cost (1, 3, or 5 years)

Laptop/Tablet + Existing Ekahau Pro

Use a new device to run their existing Ekahau Pro software

? Lower cost if they already have a license 

? Flexibility to choose any hardware 

? Less portable than Sidekick 2 

? May require manual calibration for accuracy

 

I’ll get a quote for each of the options. Have I understood you correctly?

Let me know your thoughts.

 

Ta,

	Caution: External email. Do not open attachments or click links, unless this email comes from a known sender and you know the content is safe. 

 

Hi David,

 

As we get our ekahau pro support via yourselves, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible.

 

We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.

 

Thanks,

Colin

Stuart,

 

Before I send this to Mat . . . is there anything that you want to add? Or are you happy with it going out like this for now?

 

P.S. It took a while to get the part numbers on to Dynamics. ??

 

Hi Mat,

 

Please find attached the quote (QUO-17351) for the Blyott Proof of Concept (PoC) at Keele University. This initial quote is based on a three-month PoC, but we can adjust the term to 6, 9, or 12 months depending on your preference. Let me know what works best for you, and I’ll get updated pricing over to you.

 

To summarise, the PoC will provide tracking capabilities for keys, medical assets, and high-value library books, utilizing 1,000 Aruba AOS10.7.x access points to ensure comprehensive campus coverage. It also includes WebHooks & REST APIs, which could support workflow automation and potential integration with Qolcom Vision if needed.

 

If you have any questions or need any modifications, let me know, and I’ll be happy to assist.

 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

 

Best regards,



David Dunlop

So, I have had a look and, here are some basics before I get some quotes.

 

 

Available Options & Key Considerations

Option

Details

Considerations

Ekahau Sidekick 2

A dedicated mobile solution for Wi-Fi site surveys

? Ideal for mobile use, accurate and efficient 

? Self-calibrating for precise RF measurements 

? Higher upfront cost compared to using a laptop

Ekahau Connect Subscription

Required if using Sidekick 2 with iOS/Android apps

? Enables use with Ekahau Survey App (iOS/Android) 

? Includes Ekahau Cloud, Analyzer, and Sidekick support 

? Subscription-based cost (1, 3, or 5 years)

Laptop/Tablet + Existing Ekahau Pro

Use a new device to run their existing Ekahau Pro software

? Lower cost if they already have a license 

? Flexibility to choose any hardware 

? Less portable than Sidekick 2 

? May require manual calibration for accuracy

 

I’ll get a quote for each of the options. Have I understood you correctly?

Let me know your thoughts.

 

Ta,

Hi David,

 

As we get our ekahau pro support via yourselves, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible.

 

We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.

 

Thanks,

Colin

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) 

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) 

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) 

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors 

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan 

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) 

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

Hi Andrew, 

 

I messaged you the other week to see if we could get a catch up regarding the ClearPass project. We had a call earlier with Glen about things in general and we had a few questions, but he suggested catching up with yourself regarding the security/ClearPass project. Do you have any time for a call with myself and Mike Ashby? Just for an update and we can share what we've done so far.

Tim,

 

 

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following:  

 

- DU3 - 19th College  

  - Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1)  

  - Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2)  

  - 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1)  

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad  

  - Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors  

  - Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan  

  - Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable)  

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of?  

 

Thanks,

 

David

Subject:	Re: Northumbria University,Qolcom,Aruba - On-site Campus Fabric Tech Session - 18th March

Hi Kevin, Len, David, Tharanga, Gavin,  

Following on from Mike’s email, we propose to attend Northumbria University on Monday, 17th March (with HPE Aruba) for a session covering the HPE Aruba roadmap, strategy, and technology discussions.  

This visit will complement the Fabric-focused session scheduled for the 18th March with Joe Neville and provide a broader overview of Aruba’s direction, aligning with your networking plans. We’d be happy to tailor the agenda based on any specific areas you’d like us to cover.  

Please let us know if this date works for you and if there are any key topics you’d like us to prioritise.  

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

Best regards,  

David

Hi Kevin, Len, David, Tharanga, Gavin, 

 

Good to see you all on the call last week. 

 

I’m in the area with Joe Neville, Aruba Technology Strategist focussed on Fabric Networks week commencing 17th March. We are available to come to campus for a meeting during the morning of the 18th (09:00-11:00) if this works for yourselves?

 

This would be supplementary to the broader session we are planning with Qolcom, however I think it will be valuable to also meet with Joe, specifically on the subject of Fabrics given his expertise in this area, your current core project and potential options to expand this to the edge of the network in future.

 

Please kindly let me know asap if we can get this arranged?

 

FYI – Joe has also posted an EVPN-VXLAN explainer on the Aruba Airheads Broadcasting Channel which may be of interest to you. I have had very positive feedback on this from other customers who are beginning to deploy fabrics;

Hi All,

 

As Keith has mentioned, we shall be sending out an emailer next week to update customers on the timeline of the merger with Bechtle.

 

I’m not sure how up to date your contacts are on Dynamics so please could you double check them before we send out the emails?

 

I have created a view for each of you in your contacts called ‘MKTG Active Contacts – (Your Initials)’.  In that view you will see if a contact has ‘Send Marketing Materials’ or ‘Do Not Send Marketing Materials’ against them.

 

Any contacts that have ‘Send’ against will receive the mailer. If that flag needs to be amended, please do so. 

 

Let me know if you have any questions. 

 

Thanks,

 

Kelly

Also . . . I want to stay on Stu’s good books, so sending out AI generated content wouldn’t go down too well with him. ??

Also . . . I want to stay on Stu’s good books, so sending out AI generated content wouldn’t go down too well with him. ?? I just use it for exactly what I said on the call  . . . when a techie speaks I just write down the words and see if I can get an English or real world interpretation so I understand it better.

Hi Alex and Paul,  

 

I hope you’re both doing well and that the start of the year hasn’t been too hectic!  

 

I just wanted to follow up on the Network Equipment RFI we submitted in January to see if there are any updates on next steps. We appreciate that this was an early market engagement exercise, but I wanted to check if there’s been any further discussion around potential timelines for a formal procurement process.  

 

No rush at all, but if there’s anything we should be aware of or any further input needed from our side, just let me know. Looking forward to catching up soon.  

 

Regards, 

 

David Dunlop

This is a very simple view of the techjam update that I put together (with the assistance of my virtual friend). I do have a lot more, so let me know if you need/want any more that I have.

If its no use please let me know either way . . . I can take it. ??

Stel,

 

I have the quote for the Keele University Aps now. Can you help me understand what they can get for swapping out 12 x AP-585 aps?

Based on Mat Bailey’s request, Keele University is looking to achieve the following:

 

Objectives:

1.	Swap Access Points

	*	Exchange 12x AP-585 units for AP-587 models.
	*	Ensure the best possible swap ratio (likely considering value or stock availability).
	*	All AP-585 units are unused and still boxed, which may facilitate the swap.

 

Thanks,

Kelly,

 

Just spoke to Stuart Mo . . . he is going to get the serial numbers for the AP-=303s and send them over.

 

Also . . . I was just thinking, as they have 10 x AP-505s in stock and not installed yet, do they not still need to be paying for software updates? Or only once they start using them?

Hi David,

 

The renewal is for the x525 AP’s he purchased 3 years ago. 

 

If we need to remove x15 of them and add x24 303’s then I will need an export of the serials as PBS is backed off against specific AP’s.

 

The cost price probably won’t be that different but I need to back off the right kit.

 

Thanks,

Apologies for the delay in getting this to you. I am also just waiting on Stel from Westcoast to tell me how many AP-587s you can get for the swap out. Hopefully won’t be long.

Hi David, 

 

Could we get this quote changed please to be:

 

6 x AP-270-MNT-H3

1 x AP-270-MNT-H1

 

And if you can make sure Kate is copied in, we can get it raised next week.

 

Many thanks,

Mat

Hi David, 

 

We have 12 AP585's remaining that we would like to swap for AP587. Could you let us know how many AP587s we could get by returning these please?

 

These are the serial numbers:

CNQGL1M02V

CNQGL1M06H

CNPSL1M01T

CNQGL1M03Y

CNQGL1M04D

CNQGL1M06G

CNQGL1M00G

CNQGL1M06F

CNQGL1M035

CNQGL1M06L

CNPSL1M01B

CNQGL1M055

 

They are all still boxed and haven't been undone.

 

We are also looking for a couple of extra AP-270-MNT-H1 mounts. Could we get a price for these please?

 

Thanks,

Mat

Stel,

 

I have the quote for the Keele University Aps now. Can you help me understand what they can get for swapping out 12 x AP-585 aps?

Based on Mat Bailey’s request, Keele University is looking to achieve the following:

 

Objectives:

1.	Swap Access Points

	*	Exchange 12x AP-585 units for AP-587 models.
	*	Ensure the best possible swap ratio (likely considering value or stock availability).
	*	All AP-585 units are unused and still boxed, which may facilitate the swap.

 

Thanks,

Tim,


I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following:  

- DU3 - 19th College  
  - Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1)  
  - Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2)  
  - 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1)  

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad  
  - Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors  
  - Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan  
  - Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable)  

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of?  

Thanks,

David

Alan,

I've been sent this for the renewal quote for Cumberland Council, but I've shared it with Kelly to see how it compares to what she has. 

However, I was hoping that you could have a quick look at what they have and make some observations? For example, I see they have some 200 series access points, and they are also on AOS 8.10. I'm sure that's fine for now but if you could have a look over it and let me know your thoughts on anything I should probably include in my response regarding end of sale/life and support.


Thanks,

David

Hi Lee,

 

Thank you for your response and for clarifying the status of the RFI. 

 

We appreciate the opportunity to contribute to the University’s evaluation and are pleased to hear that the insights provided have been valuable in shaping the next steps. Could you kindly confirm whether Qolcom (A Bechtle Group Company) is being considered for the upcoming closed RfP exercise? We are keen to continue supporting the University of Manchester and would welcome the opportunity to participate in the next phase. Additionally, if possible, we would appreciate any brief feedback on our submission to help us refine our approach for future engagements.

 

Thanks again for your time, and I look forward to your response.

Hi David, 

 

The communication was issued on the 11th Feb and the RFI has now been archived and can’t be accessed.  The message was:

 

The University would like to express thanks for your involvement in this RFI exercise. Your responses have given great insight into your products, and to the wider market in general, and we now have sufficient information to confirm our next steps. 

 

We will shortly proceed to a closed RfP exercise which may lead to a formal product selection, and you will be informed separately if your product is being considered for this additional stage of the procurement exercise. As such, there will be no further communication via this RFI within the University In Tend system and it will shortly be closed. 

 

Please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any further questions and thank you for the time and effort put into your contributions to this exercise.

 

Kind regards

Hi Lee,

I am hoping you can help me. I received an email from the University of Manchester procurement system regarding a "correspondence notification" related to the project: Partner to Provide Network Equipment and Related Professional Services - Request for Information (RFI). The email states: "New correspondence has been published to the secure area of The University of Manchester website. Click this link to go to the website."

I assumed this to the In-Tend portal, where we originally submitted our response, I logged in but could not find any new correspondence related to this RFI. Could you kindly confirm, if I am looking in the wrong place for the correspondence? Or if the RFI status has changed (e.g., closed, withdrawn, or replaced)?

I appreciate your time and assistance in clarifying this. Please let me know if you need any further details.

Subject:	Qolcom - Clarification on Correspondence Notification for Network Equipment RFI (Project Ref: 3076 - Network30RFI/LD/JL)

Importance:	High

Hi Lee,

I am hoping you can help me. I received an email from the University of Manchester procurement system regarding a "correspondence notification" related to the project: Partner to Provide Network Equipment and Related Professional Services - Request for Information (RFI). The email states: "New correspondence has been published to the secure area of The University of Manchester website. Click this link to go to the website."

I assumed this to the In-Tend portal, where we originally submitted our response, I logged in but could not find any new correspondence related to this RFI. Could you kindly confirm, if I am looking in the wrong place for the correspondence? Or if the RFI status has changed (e.g., closed, withdrawn, or replaced)?

I appreciate your time and assistance in clarifying this. Please let me know if you need any further details.

Best regards,



David Dunlop

Hi Alex and Paul,  

I hope you’re both doing well and that the start of the year hasn’t been too hectic!  

I just wanted to follow up on the Network Equipment RFI we submitted in January to see if there are any updates on next steps. We appreciate that this was an early market engagement exercise, but I wanted to check if there’s been any further discussion around potential timelines for a formal procurement process.  

No rush at all, but if there’s anything we should be aware of or any further input needed from our side, just let me know. Looking forward to catching up soon.  

Regards, 

David Dunlop

Here you go. 


Remove the AD stuff

 

Keep the Sensor and Subs MoQ’s as they are. 

 

We can multiply up if we want to present a 6 or 12 month option to Mat.

Simon,

 

Remy will send an updated quote with the quantity of the options “0”.

AD is indeed not needed, but pricing should not have been included.

 

The MoQ for licenses is indeed always 500; the MoQ for tags is 100 (but we can be flexible for the hardware e.g. combination). 

As indicated before: we don’t do “PoC’s”, this is the min. we propose but the client can cancel “if not happy” after 3 months.

Hi Simon,

 

Just a query. 


Do we need the active directory part codes? We are not planning on integration with AD at this point. 

 

Why is there a 500 tag subscription for 100 tags over 3 months – is that a minimum level?

 

Thanks,


Stu.

Good afternoon and I hope you are well. 

 

Following on from the interchanges between yourself and Blyott, please see the attached. 

 

Gery has confirmed that even though his quotation is offering the T2 tags, he will happily supply whichever tags are needed (as per the below, youd suggest: T2, tiny tags and possibly sticker tags). 

 

Everything has been quoted against three months so, if you would need the costs for 12 months, its simple multiplication based on subscription costs, webhooks and Rest APIs

 

If you should need anything else or, should have any further questions – please give me a call or drop me a mail.

Hi Lars/Gery,

 

Apologies for the delay in our response. 

 

I think initially it would be ideal to understand the full costs for 1 year and then make a case for the pilot from there. 

 

Number of APs: 1000 access points running Aruba AOS10.7.x from Central

Number of Tags for keyrings: 50 for Pilot (100 in final solution)

Number of Tags for medical assets (manequins) : 20 for Pilot (200 in final solution)

Number of stickers for Library Books: 20 for Pilot (100+ in Final Solution)

 

Please let me know if you have any more questions about this opportunity. 

 

Thanks,


Stuart.

Hi Lars,

 

Yes, It’s an Aruba infrastructure, with the customer halfway through a migration from AOS8 to AOS10 cloud managed, so will have to work with that. 

 

We need to put a proposal together for a Pilot for the Keys, Medical Assets and Library books with as minimal cost as possible, but understand it will cost something, so a quote from you guys would be great. 

 

Nick is fine, always busy and I am sure he is talking about Blyott to all of his NHS and Logistics customers. 

 

Thanks,


Stuart.

Hi Stuart,

 

Sounds promising, any idea about numbers/budget – WIFI infrastructure I assume ARUBA?

 

What do you expect from us to make this happen? Can we quote something?

 

BTW – how is Nick doing, been a while since I heard from our talkative friend.. ??

Subject: RE: Keele University - Key Fobs

Hi Lars,

 

Following a call with the customer today we have some more detail on the size of the pilot and some very interesting additional use cases that we can include:

 

The pilot does not need to include student accommodation, just the main campus buildings, which will total approx. 1,000 access points. 

 

Estates Keys

 

The Prime Use case is the tracking of high value keys or sets of keys that get loaned out. 

 

Secondary use cases include:

 

Medical School

 

The University has a medical school (Darwin Building) which has some very high value assets that need to be tracked. For the pilot they will focus on 4 mannequins that are used for teaching. Each mannequin has an associated box of technology paired with it, both mannequin and the box need to be tagged and appropriate workflows be configured. 

 

There is additional kit that will need to be tracked if the pilot is successful including kit that goes into an Ambulance that they use. 

 

The University has a close relationship with Royal Stoke Hospital so this could be a great opportunity to demonstrate Blyott to the NHS. 

 

Library Books

 

There is a requirement to track high value library books that are not allowed to be checked out of the library , but get purposefully misplaced by students. The pilot will need to determine of the system has enough granularity for making this a success

 

As you can see there is some really good opportunity to demonstrate to the University how a campus wide asset tracking solution can be used to solved all sorts of problems. 

 

What are your thoughts?

 

Thanks,

Hi Stuart,

 

We’d like to participate in this, but I think we to insist to broaden the scope of the initial pilot, otherwise we will gain no value in setting this up, I’m sure if they have 2k AP they have a lot of valuable assets that might be interesting to provide with a tag across campus.. ??

Subject: Keele University - Key Fobs

Hi Lars,

 

Based on a conversation with Keele University Estates team at the end of last year, they would very much like to understand the costs to run a pilot for tracking sets of keys around the campus. Bear in mind this is an initial use case and if successful will lead to other uses. 

 

Can we please have some indicative costs for a pilot deployment for the following:

 

*	50 Blyott Tags (Suitable to be attached to a set of keys – BT-T2?). 
*	Integration with a large portion of the Campus, if not all of it, to make the pilot successful. The site has a total of approx. 2,000 access points
*	Blyott Platform access for pilot period

 

Note: There will be no Asset register integration required as the University do not currently record the Keys in an asset registry other than a databased, so we can add all Asset information manually. 

 

If you have any further questions about this then do not hesitate to contact David or Myself. 

 

Best Regards,


Stuart.

You mention Elvet Hill and Hild Bede however all the drawings (16) are named Elvet Hill!

 

We have:

 

Elvet Hill B1 Level 00 – Level 04 (5)

Elvet Hill B2 Level 00 – Level 04 (5)

Elvet Hill B3 Level B1 – Level 04 (6)

 

Nothing seen that mentions Hild Bede, is that correct?

	Subject: RE: Keele Case Study – A Couple of Thoughts

	 

	Keith,

	 

	The case study looks good. Qolcom’s role comes through a lot more, and it ties in well with Keele’s long-term vision. A couple of things that I thought of:

	 

	*	Why Qolcom? In terms of showing our contribution, its much better, but there’s still quite a bit of focus on Aruba’s solutions. What about a short section explicitly highlighting what sets Qolcom apart, our strategic input, security expertise, and long-term support, could help highlight our value better?

	 

	*	Making it more accessible – I’m not sure about this one but I do always try and think about who was reading it and what level they are, because some of the more technical sections (AOS10 migration, ClearPass security) might be a bit heavy for non-technical readers. Maybe a short executive summary at the start could help frame the key takeaways in a way that resonates with a broader audience.

	 

	A brief idea of what I meant below . . .
	
	Why Qolcom? A Strategic Partner in Smart Campus Transformation

	While cutting-edge technology is critical to Keele University’s smart campus vision, the true value lies in the expertise and strategic guidance behind its deployment. Qolcom goes beyond simply implementing Aruba solutions—we ensure that the network is optimized, secure, and future-proofed for Keele’s evolving needs.

	Unlike traditional resellers, Qolcom is a trusted technology partner with deep expertise in higher education digital transformation, network security, and cloud-managed networking. Our hands-on approach, from design consultation to ongoing lifecycle management, allows Keele to maximize its investment and continuously innovate.

	 

	What Sets Qolcom Apart?

	 

	? Consultative Approach – We worked closely with Keele’s IT team to align Aruba technology with their broader sustainability and smart campus roadmap.
	? Security & Compliance Expertise – Our engineers ensured a robust, role-based access framework using ClearPass, securing thousands of student and IoT connections.
	? Aruba Central & AOS10 Migration Leadership – We advised Keele on their transition to cloud-managed networking, resolving licensing, device registration, and procurement challenges.
	? IoT & Smart Energy Enablement – Qolcom designed the secure onboarding process for Keele’s Smart Energy Network Demonstrator (SEND) and hydrogen energy trials.
	? Long-Term Support & Optimization – Unlike one-time deployments, we provide ongoing advisory services to ensure Keele’s network remains agile, scalable, and high-performing.

	 

	 

	Executive Summary: Enabling Keele’s Smart Campus Future

	 

	Keele University is on a mission to create one of the most sustainable and digitally advanced campuses in the world. Through its partnership with Qolcom and HPE Aruba Networking, Keele has established a resilient, cloud-managed network that enables seamless connectivity, smart campus innovation, and research-driven sustainability initiatives.

	 

	Key Outcomes

	?? Seamless Wi-Fi & Secure Connectivity – Over 2,000 Wi-Fi 6 access points provide uninterrupted campus-wide connectivity.
	?? Smart Energy & IoT Deployment – A scalable, AI-driven network powers real-time environmental monitoring, energy optimization, and research.
	?? Cloud-Managed Network Evolution – Qolcom guided Keele’s Aruba Central adoption and AOS10 migration, ensuring efficiency, automation, and long-term cost savings.
	?? Future-Proofed IT Strategy – Keele is now positioned as a leader in higher education digital transformation, with a network designed to adapt and scale for future growth.

	 

	With Qolcom’s expertise in strategy, security, and long-term lifecycle management, Keele’s smart campus vision is not just a concept—it’s a living, evolving reality. 

	 

	Let me know what you think.

	 

	Ta,

Sorry mate, I was in the middle of a few things trying to get somethings out. I know it's a lot, but I was just trying to get across that it still has a big focus on the Aruba solutions and not so much our capabilities and value.

If you can wait until tomorrow I'll have more time to see what sections we can amend and include a bit more about ourselves and our added value? Let me have a look tonight and catch up tomorrow.

Subject: RE: Keele Case Study – A Couple of Thoughts

 

Keith,

 

The case study looks good. Qolcom’s role comes through a lot more, and it ties in well with Keele’s long-term vision. A couple of things that I thought of:

 

*	Why Qolcom? In terms of showing our contribution, its much better, but there’s still quite a bit of focus on Aruba’s solutions. What about a short section explicitly highlighting what sets Qolcom apart, our strategic input, security expertise, and long-term support, could help highlight our value better?

 

*	Making it more accessible – I’m not sure about this one but I do always try and think about who was reading it and what level they are, because some of the more technical sections (AOS10 migration, ClearPass security) might be a bit heavy for non-technical readers. Maybe a short executive summary at the start could help frame the key takeaways in a way that resonates with a broader audience.

 

A brief idea of what I meant below . . .

Why Qolcom? A Strategic Partner in Smart Campus Transformation

While cutting-edge technology is critical to Keele University’s smart campus vision, the true value lies in the expertise and strategic guidance behind its deployment. Qolcom goes beyond simply implementing Aruba solutions—we ensure that the network is optimized, secure, and future-proofed for Keele’s evolving needs.

Unlike traditional resellers, Qolcom is a trusted technology partner with deep expertise in higher education digital transformation, network security, and cloud-managed networking. Our hands-on approach, from design consultation to ongoing lifecycle management, allows Keele to maximize its investment and continuously innovate.

 

What Sets Qolcom Apart?

 

? Consultative Approach – We worked closely with Keele’s IT team to align Aruba technology with their broader sustainability and smart campus roadmap.
? Security & Compliance Expertise – Our engineers ensured a robust, role-based access framework using ClearPass, securing thousands of student and IoT connections.
? Aruba Central & AOS10 Migration Leadership – We advised Keele on their transition to cloud-managed networking, resolving licensing, device registration, and procurement challenges.
? IoT & Smart Energy Enablement – Qolcom designed the secure onboarding process for Keele’s Smart Energy Network Demonstrator (SEND) and hydrogen energy trials.
? Long-Term Support & Optimization – Unlike one-time deployments, we provide ongoing advisory services to ensure Keele’s network remains agile, scalable, and high-performing.

 

 

Executive Summary: Enabling Keele’s Smart Campus Future

 

Keele University is on a mission to create one of the most sustainable and digitally advanced campuses in the world. Through its partnership with Qolcom and HPE Aruba Networking, Keele has established a resilient, cloud-managed network that enables seamless connectivity, smart campus innovation, and research-driven sustainability initiatives.

 

Key Outcomes

?? Seamless Wi-Fi & Secure Connectivity – Over 2,000 Wi-Fi 6 access points provide uninterrupted campus-wide connectivity.
?? Smart Energy & IoT Deployment – A scalable, AI-driven network powers real-time environmental monitoring, energy optimization, and research.
?? Cloud-Managed Network Evolution – Qolcom guided Keele’s Aruba Central adoption and AOS10 migration, ensuring efficiency, automation, and long-term cost savings.
?? Future-Proofed IT Strategy – Keele is now positioned as a leader in higher education digital transformation, with a network designed to adapt and scale for future growth.

 

With Qolcom’s expertise in strategy, security, and long-term lifecycle management, Keele’s smart campus vision is not just a concept—it’s a living, evolving reality. 

 

Let me know what you think.

Subject:	RE: Qolcom - HPE Aruba - NAC - LAN 8021x PoC

Andrew,

Thank you for your follow-up questions. Below are responses to your queries regarding the ClearPass licensing quote:

1.	Is this a perpetual license rather than an annual charge?

	*	Yes, the quoted ClearPass Access Licenses are perpetual. This means that once purchased, they do not expire, and you retain the rights to use them indefinitely.

2.	How long does "perpetual" last?

	*	The licenses remain valid for as long as you are using the current ClearPass platform. However, if Aruba releases a major platform upgrade or if hardware dependencies change, there may be future considerations for licensing adjustments or migration. Typically, customers receive many years of usage before any upgrade considerations arise.

3.	Is there any recurrent maintenance charge that increases if we add these licenses?

	*	While the licenses themselves are perpetual, ongoing support and software updates require an active support contract. If you already have an active support agreement for ClearPass, adding additional licenses will increase the annual support cost proportionally. The support contract ensures access to software updates, patches, and technical assistance. We can provide an estimated impact on your support costs based on this quote.

4.	Could we add the licenses in two batches at the same price (20% this financial year, 80% next financial year)?

	*	We can certainly explore phased purchasing options. However, pricing is subject to potential changes over time, so we would need to confirm if the same price can be secured for the next financial year. I will discuss this with HPE Aruba to see what can be done. 

Additionally, I noted that we initially quoted 75K licenses instead of 68K to provide a better value based on available license pack options. We can review different combinations (e.g., 50K + 10K + 5K vs. 75K) to find the best cost-effective balance.

Let me know your thoughts on the responses. It might also be beneficial to arrange a call to review your target of 68K licenses. Since ClearPass licenses are concurrent and cover all active devices on the network, we want to ensure there’s no duplication in your estimate. On one hand, you may require significantly fewer licenses, but on the other, we want to avoid a situation where you unexpectedly need more than anticipated.

 

P.S. We are keen however to further discuss the PoC, as this is a vital part of the process and enablement of wired NAC policy and the above licensing.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

David,

 

Thanks for the quick turn around on the quote, as you will be aware we are going through some very stringent financial decisions at the moment so i've got some follow up questions re. the figures that i'm hoping you can answer.

 

1.	Is this a perpetual licence rather than an annual charge?

2.	Do we have some sense of how long “perpetual” lasts? If it’s for the current controller / ClearPass version then do we have any idea how long it would be before we’d need to incur the costs again.

3.	Is there any recurrent maintenance charge that increases if we add these licences?

4.	Could we add the licenses in two batches at the same price, one this financial year (20%) and the remainder next financial year (80%)?

 

Thanks,

Mat, Kate,

 

Will do . . . also, to keep you both in the loop I have chased up the AP swap out. I suspect it is very achievable, but the process is possibly a pain at the back end, so possibly why its taking a it of time. Nonetheless I will get back to you as soon as I know anything.

 

Thanks,

Hi David, 

 

Could we get this quote changed please to be:

 

6 x AP-270-MNT-H3

1 x AP-270-MNT-H1

 

And if you can make sure Kate is copied in, we can get it raised next week.

 

Many thanks,

Mat

CNPSL1M01T

CNQGL1M03Y

CNQGL1M04D

Hi Stel,  

 

Hope you’re doing well! I’ve got a quick one for you regarding a customer query. Keele University has 12 AP585s (serials below) that are still boxed and unopened, and they’re asking if it’s possible to swap these for AP587s. Could you let me know:  

 

I appreciate they will be different values and possibly a restocking fee, but in principle are you able to help out? ?? 

 

Here are the serials:  

CNQGL1M02V  

CNQGL1M06H  

CNPSL1M01T  

CNQGL1M03Y

Subject:	FW: Cancellation and Refund – ChatGPT o1 Pro Subscription

Hi, 

I am reaching out to request the cancellation and a refund for my ChatGPT o1 Pro subscription, which I purchased last week.

I used ChatGPT to determine what was available to upgrade to and it recommended o1 Pro but it now turns out that the ChatGPT Team account I have is better and more features, so upon further review, I have realized that ChatGPT o1 Pro provides fewer features than my existing ChatGPT Team subscription, including potential limitations on file uploads and advanced tools. Initially, I was under the impression that ChatGPT o1 Pro would be an upgrade, but I now understand that it does not provide additional benefits compared to what I already have.

Given that I have only had the subscription for a short time and have not found it to meet my needs, I would appreciate a refund in accordance with OpenAI’s policies.

Please let me know the next steps for processing this request. I appreciate your time and assistance.

Regards,

Hi Alan,  

Had a chat with finance, and unfortunately, we can’t process things the way you suggested. Since the original order has already been invoiced and paid, we can’t issue a new quote and PO just to hold a credit balance—that goes against both Aberdeen Uni’s and our policies.  

The cleanest way forward is to close down the current open PO (via EE), and no further invoices will be raised against it. If you still need to use the funds for future orders, it’ll need to be done separately through the usual process.  

Sorry it’s not the outcome you were hoping for, but I wanted to get you a straight answer. Let me know if you want to discuss further.  

Cheers,

David

Hola,

Your defo losing it mate. ??

 

My suggestion was you send me a quote for the switch and a PO get’s raised against that but you don’t provision the switch, instead you just adjust the credit balance.

 

That then allows a future order to be placed against the outstanding credit.

 

That work?

 

Gies a shout this afternoon and we can discuss.

Afternoon Alan,

 

Haha, well you’re definitely top of my list today! ??

 

Quick update for you:

*	AV Equipment (Transmitter/Receiver): Ordered, just waiting on an ETA—I’m chasing that up now and will let you know once I have a confirmed delivery date.
*	Credit for the Switch: Unfortunately as the switch has been invoiced etc there isn’t anything I can do with that. However I’m happy to look at alternatives if you have any ideas?

 

Appreciate your patience, and I’ll keep you posted as soon as I get the final confirmations. Let me know if you want to jump on a call later to run through anything.

Alan,

 

Apologies, one of our customers had an issue on Friday and had to sort that out, and unfortunately it slipped my mind. I'm out this afternoon but you're top of my list and I'll get that sorted by tomorrow.

 

Apologies again Alan, I'm on it now.

 

Thanks,

 

David

Hi David,

Don’t know if I missed your call on Friday but would be good to grab five minutes to close off the two outstanding order requirements.

 

I checked with Admin team today and there’s been no delivery of the transmitter/receiver yet. If you can let me know where that’s at and whether we can sort a quote for the switch to recover the credit balance.

Hi David,

Thanks for your time earlier, hope it wasn’t too much of a wasted time given you’d pulled in other folks on your side?

 

I’d hoped we’d wrap up a bit earlier and I’d have the chance for a catch up.

 

If you give me a shout on the mobile tomorrow we can cover off today’s discussions and the outstanding switch/order.

So if you issue a new quote, just based on same description, I can get a PO raised and you just invoice us as normal?

 

Then you just don’t provision the network switch and the value goes back to the credit instead, does that work?

As it's been invoiced and paid, unfortunately I can't do anything with that quote, however I'm having a look to see what else I can do to give you the same outcome.

Hi David,

I think this was the one for the network switch that we did through the credit.

 

If it saves you some effort you could just resend that with an updated date, or is that just muddying the waters?

Alan,

 

Here is your quote for the switch. I should point out though that I was expecting slightly more discount than we got, so I have asked for it to be escalated and should receive that back by tomorrow. 

However, it has taken a bit longer than usual, so I thought best to send you what we have just now in case you need to get moving on it. Also, I have included a power supply as that will be needed for this switch.

 

Let me know if there is anything else that you need.

 

P.S. If I get improved pricing back, I will share it with you regardless, but if you need to order straight away I will take the difference off of the order for Colin, so you still pay the same if that makes sense.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

Stel,

 

I’m hoping you can help me? This is the one I spoke to you about on teams, where Durham are in need of an additional 13 x AP-635s and 1 x AP-565. I’m forwarding the email chain below regarding Durham University’s order for additional APs (QUO-17256). As you can see, there is significant urgency around this delivery, with key stakeholders emphasising the need to receive the APs as soon as possible to prevent installation delays. 

 

Currently, the estimated delivery date is February 26th, but if there’s anything that can be done to accelerate this it would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if there’s any way to improve the delivery timeline, or if there are any alternative options we could explore. 

 

Thanks mate,

 

David Dunlop

Morning Yvonne,

 

I have been talking to Qolcom since the order went in to advise on the urgency of this order, at present I have a delivery date of February 26th at the latest, but they are trying to get them from a different customers order to speed up the process

 

I have updated Aceda, and suggested/agreed for them to get the cables in place so it’s just a case of fastening the AP’s to the ceiling as soon as they arrive

 

Unfortunately, as these are a fairly new model AP, we don’t have many spares, the ones we do have, have been used at Boldon already, I will keep you updated

Importance:	High

Stel,

 

I’m hoping you can help me? This is the one I spoke to you about on teams, where Durham are in need of an additional 13 x AP-635s and 1 x AP-565. I’m forwarding the email chain below regarding Durham University’s order for additional APs (QUO-17256). As you can see, there is significant urgency around this delivery, with key stakeholders emphasising the need to receive the APs as soon as possible to prevent installation delays. 

 

Currently, the estimated delivery date is February 26th, but if there’s anything that can be done to accelerate this it would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if there’s any way to improve the delivery timeline, or if there are any alternative options we could explore. 

 

Thanks mate,

 

David Dunlop

Morning Yvonne,

 

I have been talking to Qolcom since the order went in to advise on the urgency of this order, at present I have a delivery date of February 26th at the latest, but they are trying to get them from a different customers order to speed up the process

 

I have updated Aceda, and suggested/agreed for them to get the cables in place so it’s just a case of fastening the AP’s to the ceiling as soon as they arrive

 

Unfortunately, as these are a fairly new model AP, we don’t have many spares, the ones we do have, have been used at Boldon already, I will keep you updated

 

Regards

Glen,

 

I have put together indicative pricing for you just now, but as you will see I have quoted 75k instead of 68k due to that being cheaper, however we can look at various combinations of the licenses to get a balance of the amount you actually need and value. They come in 1k, 5k, 10k, 25k, 50k and 100k.

Hi Alex and Paul,  

I hope you’re both doing well and that the start of the year hasn’t been too hectic!  

I just wanted to follow up on the Network Equipment RFI we submitted in January to see if there are any updates on next steps. We appreciate that this was an early market engagement exercise, but I wanted to check if there’s been any further discussion around potential timelines for a formal procurement process.  

No rush at all, but if there’s anything we should be aware of or any further input needed from our side, just let me know. Looking forward to catching up soon.

Hi all,

Just a quick one .... We've had an email come into our sales email with purchase order but it looks a tad suspicious.

The email address is unit4@sthelens.gov.uk 


Does that look legit to you? I've attached screenshots of the email, but wanted to check before we opened the pdf that came with it.


Thanks,


David

I'll check with them but it looks like bollocks to me. The content and email disclaimer don't match any St Helens comms I've ever had.

Hi David
Can you check with your contact at St Helens that this email is valid and relates to a proper PO?  The email send address looks odd and I don't want to open the PDF without confirmation.
Thanks, Heidi

Simon, Mike,

 

Kevin is chasing for a date to get a meeting set up so I am looking for dates so we can get this in place . . . 

Kevin wants a meeting to discuss the following key points:

 

1.	Phase 2 Orders: He wants to review the next phase of orders, specifically covering the remaining distribution and aggregation switches. The goal is to install all key Aruba switches.
2.	Project Structure for Phase 1 Delivery: Kevin is looking to structure the delivery process for Phase 1. He mentioned a deadline at the end of May to avoid issues with university clearing, meaning that timelines and logistics need to be aligned.
3.	Delivery Date Estimates for Phase 1: He has requested an update on estimated delivery dates for the equipment in Phase 1.
4.	Multifabric Lab Testing & Progress: There is an issue with the multifabric lab environment. Northumbria has stood up a lab environment, but Kevin is unsure if sufficient work has been carried out to prove the solution works.

 

Kevin is calling the next Phase, Phase 2 but to avoid any doubt, for us this would be Phase 4.

 

We want to get out of this a strategy, timeline and design, as well as understanding what has actually been deployed, and integrated. Also need to define what they are doing and what they want us to do.

 

Can you both look in your calendars and suggest a date? It will be onsite.

P.S. Simon can you review the attached document and let me know of any changes?

 

Thanks,

Heidi,

 

Alan Skinner at Aberdeen is back on at me and suggesting I misunderstood his request. I replied saying we couldn’t do anything as it had already been invoiced. 

 

His idea is:

*	I send him a new quote for the same switch.
*	He raises a PO against it, but we don’t provision the switch.
*	Instead, we just adjust the credit balance so he can use it on a future order.

 

Before I go back to him, just need to check if this is something we can do and make sure it doesn’t cause any issues for us at our end.

 

Cheers,

Hi David, 

 

We have 12 AP585's remaining that we would like to swap for AP587. Could you let us know how many AP587s we could get by returning these please?

 

These are the serial numbers:

CNQGL1M02V

CNQGL1M06H

CNPSL1M01T

CNQGL1M03Y

CNQGL1M04D

CNQGL1M035

CNQGL1M06L

CNPSL1M01B

CNQGL1M055

 

They are all still boxed and haven't been undone.

 

We are also looking for a couple of extra AP-270-MNT-H1 mounts. Could we get a price for these please?

 

Thanks,

Afternoon Alan,

 

Haha, well you’re definitely top of my list today! ??

 

Quick update for you:

*	AV Equipment (Transmitter/Receiver): Ordered, just waiting on an ETA—I’m chasing that up now and will let you know once I have a confirmed delivery date.
*	Credit for the Switch: Unfortunately as the switch has been invoiced etc there isn’t anything I can do with that. However I’m happy to look at alternatives if you have any ideas?

 

Appreciate your patience, and I’ll keep you posted as soon as I get the final confirmations. Let me know if you want to jump on a call later to run through anything.

 

Cheers,

Alan,

 

Apologies, one of our customers had an issue on Friday and had to sort that out, and unfortunately it slipped my mind. I'm out this afternoon but you're top of my list and I'll get that sorted by tomorrow.

 

Apologies again Alan, I'm on it now.

 

Thanks,

 

David

Hi David,

Don’t know if I missed your call on Friday but would be good to grab five minutes to close off the two outstanding order requirements.

 

I checked with Admin team today and there’s been no delivery of the transmitter/receiver yet. If you can let me know where that’s at and whether we can sort a quote for the switch to recover the credit balance.

Hi David,

Thanks for your time earlier, hope it wasn’t too much of a wasted time given you’d pulled in other folks on your side?

 

I’d hoped we’d wrap up a bit earlier and I’d have the chance for a catch up.

 

If you give me a shout on the mobile tomorrow we can cover off today’s discussions and the outstanding switch/order.

So if you issue a new quote, just based on same description, I can get a PO raised and you just invoice us as normal?

 

Then you just don’t provision the network switch and the value goes back to the credit instead, does that work?

As it's been invoiced and paid, unfortunately I can't do anything with that quote, however I'm having a look to see what else I can do to give you the same outcome.

Hi David,

I think this was the one for the network switch that we did through the credit.

 

If it saves you some effort you could just resend that with an updated date, or is that just muddying the waters?

Alan,

 

Here is your quote for the switch. I should point out though that I was expecting slightly more discount than we got, so I have asked for it to be escalated and should receive that back by tomorrow. 

However, it has taken a bit longer than usual, so I thought best to send you what we have just now in case you need to get moving on it. Also, I have included a power supply as that will be needed for this switch.

 

Let me know if there is anything else that you need.

 

P.S. If I get improved pricing back, I will share it with you regardless, but if you need to order straight away I will take the difference off of the order for Colin, so you still pay the same if that makes sense.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

Hi Simon, 

 

Please can I chase a response for David , as I have mentioned before we do need to keep the momentum going on this project. 

 

I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it. We need to have the confidence that the multi fabric solution is going to work in our environment. 

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Subject: Multifabric Lab - weird reachability issue

 

Hi Simon,

 

We’ve run into an issue in the lab environment.

 

Len suggested we extend the lab, in order to include a Cisco device that was hosting an SVI as a gateway for Layer 2 spanned networks. We had done this successfully already in the off-campus environment, but not with the multi-fabric setup.

 

I’ll briefly explain but perhaps a call might help if that is possible? 

 

So, we have a Cisco switch connected to CC-BL . The Cisco switch hosts an SVI (VLAN 200 in the lab) and also an OSPF adjacency with CC-BL (using VLAN 951). What we have noticed is:

*	All VTEP devices see all consistent information in:

	*	Vrf campus RIB
	*	BGP L2VPN EVPN

*	Only CC-BL and CL-BL can source a ping from their VRF campus loopbacks and local SVIs and reach the SVI hosted on Cisco (VLAN 200) – all other VTEPs cannot do this
*	The Cisco VLAN 200 SVI is fully reachable via VLAN 200 clients in the fabric no matter which VTEP they are connected to.
*	VLAN 200 clients in the fabric can actually ping SVIs and loopbacks in the fabric (e.g. Colo loopback in vrf campus) suggesting we are routing via the Cisco into the fabric ok, however the reverse ping is not functional

 

I’m drawing a bit of a blank on it at the moment and will need to dismantle the lab shortly for equipment redeploy – no doubt we will seek to come back to this after we do get the kit redeployed but thought it might be of interest to you before we down the lab as it might take a few weeks to reinstate this scenario after next week.

 

Many thanks,

Hi David,

 

Not sure what to go back to Bob with on this one…

 

I have sent the hide pricing quote so everything is bundled into two lines. Attached is the unbundled price which shows zero costs to St Helen’s for the sensors which I’m guessing you chucked in to sweeten the deal when you quoted it…

 

What do you want me to do?

 

Thanks,

 

Kelly

## **Case Study: Building the Next Generation Smart Campus at Keele University**  
*(Source: [90]†Case Study - Building the Next Generation Smart Campus at Keele University.pdf)*  

### **Introduction**  
Keele University, aiming to become a **“University of the Future,”** embarked on a mission to build a **sustainable smart campus**. The first phase of this **large-scale transformation** was completed through a **strategic partnership between Qolcom Ltd and HPE Aruba**.  

This initiative sought to **enhance connectivity, support research and innovation**, and **integrate IoT capabilities** to create a future-ready, technology-driven campus.  

---

### **The Challenge**  
Keele University’s vision was to establish a **next-generation smart campus** that would:  

- **Serve as a test bed for innovation**, offering a **scalable, secure, and intelligent digital environment**.  
- **Support diverse users**, including students, researchers, faculty, and **IoT-based research projects**.  
- **Deliver sustainable and future-proof network solutions** while maintaining high security and reliability.  

#### **Key Issues Identified**:  
- The need for **a unified and high-performance network** to support smart research, sustainability projects, and future AI-driven applications.  
- The challenge of ensuring **seamless integration with IoT devices** across a large, mixed-use campus environment.  
- Security concerns around **data integrity, privacy, and future expansion** into AI and smart city technologies.  

---

### **The Partnership**  
The partnership between **Qolcom Ltd and HPE Aruba** was built on:  

- A **shared vision** to enable a **data-driven, high-performance campus infrastructure**.  
- Expertise in **designing and deploying Aruba’s cutting-edge wireless solutions** tailored for **high-density environments**.  
- A **commitment to sustainability**, ensuring the network would support **low-energy, long-term campus initiatives**.  

---

### **The Solution**  
The smart campus initiative was built on **HPE Aruba’s advanced wireless and security solutions**, incorporating **best-in-class** network design.  

#### **Key Features of the Network Infrastructure**:  

1. **High-Speed Connectivity**  
   - Designed for **seamless, high-speed Wi-Fi access** across the entire 617-acre campus.  
   - Supported **over 2,000 access points**, including both **indoor and outdoor coverage**.  

2. **Security-Driven Architecture**  
   - **Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager** enabled **role-based access control**, ensuring **secure connectivity** for students, staff, and visitors.

	Here is their differentiator ...

	Software Asset Management (SAM) is a **strategic approach** to managing, optimizing, and controlling an organization's software licenses and assets. It ensures that software investments are **cost-effective, compliant, and fully utilized** across an organization.

	### **Key Benefits of SAM**
	1. **Cost Optimization** – Avoid overpaying for unused or underutilized licenses.
	2. **Compliance & Risk Management** – Reduce the risk of software audits, non-compliance fines, and legal risks.
	3. **License Optimization** – Ensure you have the right licenses for your needs, neither over- nor under-licensed.
	4. **Security & Standardization** – Identify outdated, unsupported, or redundant software that may introduce security risks.
	5. **Cloud & Hybrid Management** – Manage software across on-premise, cloud, and hybrid environments.

	---

	### **How Does Bechtle’s SAM Differ from Standard License Sales?**
	Most Microsoft resellers simply sell licenses, but Bechtle offers **end-to-end** SAM services to help organizations manage their software more effectively. 

	#### **1. Bechtle's SAM Services**
	- **SAM as a Service** – Continuous, proactive monitoring and optimization of software usage.
	- **SAM Baseline** – A one-time analysis to assess software inventory, compliance, and optimization opportunities.
	- **SAM Cloud Readiness** – Evaluates your current software setup and prepares for cloud transition (Azure, M365, etc.).
	- **SAM Consulting & Audits** – Expert advisory to avoid compliance risks and unexpected costs.

	#### **2. How Bechtle Adds Value**
	- **Microsoft Licensing Expertise** – Bechtle helps organizations navigate complex Microsoft licensing models (M365, Azure, CSP, EA, SPLA, etc.).
	- **Automated Software Tracking** – Uses **SAM tools** to track software deployment, usage, and renewal dates.
	- **Audit-Readiness & Risk Mitigation** – Prepares companies for potential vendor audits by ensuring compliance.

	---

	### **Why Choose Bechtle for Microsoft Licensing?**
	? **Cost Efficiency** – Bechtle ensures you're **not paying for unnecessary licenses** while staying compliant.  
	? **Cloud Optimization** – Helps companies **transition to the cloud efficiently** while managing hybrid environments.  
	? **Proactive Compliance Management** – Minimizes risks of **unexpected audits or license breaches**.  
	? **Enterprise-Level Reporting & Insights** – Organizations get **visibility** into their software usage, waste, and renewal cycles.  

	---

	### **Is SAM Worth It?**
	If your organization:
	- Spends **a significant amount** on Microsoft licenses.
	- Uses **hybrid or multi-cloud environments** (M365, Azure, on-prem).
	- Wants to **optimize IT budgets** and reduce software overspending.
	- Wants to be **audit-ready** and ensure compliance.

	Then **SAM services** like those offered by Bechtle can provide **long-term cost savings and risk reduction** beyond just buying licenses.

	Would you like a comparison of Bechtle’s SAM services vs. other major Microsoft resellers like Softcat, Insight, or Bytes?

Hi David,

 

Not sure what to go back to Bob with on this one…

 

I have sent the hide pricing quote so everything is bundled into two lines. Attached is the unbundled price which shows zero costs to St Helen’s for the sensors which I’m guessing you chucked in to sweeten the deal when you quoted it…

 

What do you want me to do?

H Andrew,

 

There is a HLD for the overall fabric solution which we have proposed, though no specific proposal has been created for the professional services piece.

 

Let’s schedule a call for next week when I am back in the UK to go over the requirements.

 

Thanks,

Simon

Subject:	Qolcom - Patch Cables
Attachments:	103-267-10.pdf

Michael, Kevin, Lisa, Nuaim,

 

Quick update on the patch cables for your various orders — our supplier has informed us that the 0.3m yellow and green Excel patch leads have been discontinued. However, they’ve suggested an alternative:

Excel Cat6A Mini Patch Leads (0.3m, 28AWG, LSOH, Blade Booted), which offer:

 

*	Same Cat6A spec, supporting 10GBase-T and PoE++.
*	Thinner, more flexible design (4.8mm diameter), making cable management easier.
*	Screened shielding for better signal integrity.
*	Smaller RJ45 connectors, designed for high-density patching.

 

The main difference is that these are mini patch leads, meaning a slightly thinner cable and smaller connectors compared to standard ones. I’ve attached the spec sheet so you can review the details.

Let me know your thoughts.

 

Cheers,



 

David Dunlop

Kevin, Michael,

 

Apologies for the delay in this one. This kit had been added to a single quote from Aruba for the access layer refresh and the AP-655s that were ordered, but unfortunately Aruba didn’t let me or anyone else know they had bundled this all together.

 

There is a delay for patch leads until March so I hope that isn’t going to cause you any further delays.

 

Thanks,

One more before I disappear ?? Could you help David out with the below please? We’re looking to supply some AV kit in to one of our customers. It’s public sector and goes via an existing framework agreement, so ideally can you please quote David and we’ll uplift?

	Ben,

	 

	Can you find out who I would need to speak to at Bechtle regarding quoting for AV kit? Aberdeen ask me all the time and we have always declined but Bechtle do have AV listed so worth a shot.

	 

	Let me know if there is anyone you can put me in contact with.

	Hi David,

	Re below, if you are now able to get the AV stuff then the following should be doable with the remaining credit balance:

	 

	TP-583Rxr 4K HDR HDMI Receiver with RS–232 & IR over Extended–Reach HDBaseT (kramerav.com) <https://www1.kramerav.com/product/TP-583Rxr> 
	TP-583Txr 4K HDR HDMI Transmitter with RS–232 & IR over Extended–Reach HDBaseT (kramerav.com) <https://www1.kramerav.com/product/TP-583Txr> 

	 

	Let me know if that’s ok and, that being the case I might get you to issue a formal quote for the switch you already provided. I could then raise a PO against that so the credit comes back for other AV kit.

	 

	Not sure if that get’s too complicated but we can discuss.

	 

	Ta

	Alan

Alan,

Apologies, one of our customers had an issue on Friday and had to sort that out, and unfortunately it slipped my mind. I'm out this afternoon but you're top of my list and I'll get that sorted by tomorrow.

Apologies again Alan, I'm on it now.

Thanks,

David

Hi David,

Don’t know if I missed your call on Friday but would be good to grab five minutes to close off the two outstanding order requirements.

 

I checked with Admin team today and there’s been no delivery of the transmitter/receiver yet. If you can let me know where that’s at and whether we can sort a quote for the switch to recover the credit balance.

Hi David,

Thanks for your time earlier, hope it wasn’t too much of a wasted time given you’d pulled in other folks on your side?

 

I’d hoped we’d wrap up a bit earlier and I’d have the chance for a catch up.

 

If you give me a shout on the mobile tomorrow we can cover off today’s discussions and the outstanding switch/order.

So if you issue a new quote, just based on same description, I can get a PO raised and you just invoice us as normal?

 

Then you just don’t provision the network switch and the value goes back to the credit instead, does that work?

As it's been invoiced and paid, unfortunately I can't do anything with that quote, however I'm having a look to see what else I can do to give you the same outcome.

Hi David,

I think this was the one for the network switch that we did through the credit.

 

If it saves you some effort you could just resend that with an updated date, or is that just muddying the waters?

Alan,

 

Here is your quote for the switch. I should point out though that I was expecting slightly more discount than we got, so I have asked for it to be escalated and should receive that back by tomorrow. 

However, it has taken a bit longer than usual, so I thought best to send you what we have just now in case you need to get moving on it. Also, I have included a power supply as that will be needed for this switch.

 

Let me know if there is anything else that you need.

 

P.S. If I get improved pricing back, I will share it with you regardless, but if you need to order straight away I will take the difference off of the order for Colin, so you still pay the same if that makes sense.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

Hi Heidi

 

I have had feedback from Excel and they have said the yellow and green 0.3m patch leads have been discontinued. 

 

They can supply these sizes in the 0.3m in a mini patch lead.

Hi David,

DTT only have stock of the line with qty 30 – the rest are not available until March.  They also have no stock of singles either.

Any ideas how we can sort this out or where else we can source them from?  Or is the wait OK?

Hi Projects/Shane, 

 

I’ve sent a couple of Teams messages to Shane about the attached doc. I wondered if you maybe had some time tomorrow to discuss please? 

 

Myself, Ben and David briefly discussed approach last week. We sold a PS engagement for a CPPM PoC and Pilot previously to Durham for wired NAC and although it was started I understand it essentially dried up.

 

I also wanted a view on whether we think this can all be done remotely. 

 

Thanks,

Mike

I’ve amended the Solution Outline to include the BOM changes made yesterday. 

 

Specifically, changing the UXI text to the LTE model and subscription, and updating the Bill of Materials section.

Hi David,

Thanks for your time earlier, hope it wasn’t too much of a wasted time given you’d pulled in other folks on your side?

 

I’d hoped we’d wrap up a bit earlier and I’d have the chance for a catch up.

 

If you give me a shout on the mobile tomorrow we can cover off today’s discussions and the outstanding switch/order.

Alan,

 

Here is your quote for the switch. I should point out though that I was expecting slightly more discount than we got, so I have asked for it to be escalated and should receive that back by tomorrow. 

However, it has taken a bit longer than usual, so I thought best to send you what we have just now in case you need to get moving on it. Also, I have included a power supply as that will be needed for this switch.

 

Let me know if there is anything else that you need.

 

P.S. If I get improved pricing back, I will share it with you regardless, but if you need to order straight away I will take the difference off of the order for Colin, so you still pay the same if that makes sense.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

Alan,

 

Here is your quote for the switch. I should point out though that I was expecting slightly more discount than we got, so I have asked for it to be escalated and should receive that back by tomorrow. 

However, it has taken a bit longer than usual, so I thought best to send you what we have just now in case you need to get moving on it. Also, I have included a power supply as that will be needed for this switch.

 

Let me know if there is anything else that you need.

 

P.S. If I get improved pricing back, I will share it with you regardless, but if you need to order straight away I will take the difference off of the order for Colin, so you still pay the same if that makes sense.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

Yeah I know mate ... was just in case you knew if anywhere. Simon is usually telling me about places to get third party transceivers etc so I thought I'd ask. 

No worries.

Hi David, 

 

Presales are probably the worst to ask this question as we’re not involved in the buying process. 

 

Maybe try Sales colleagues if Heidi and her team don’t know or we don’t have preferred suppliers for network accessories. 

 

If I had to order some, I’d just use our friend Google. See FS cables below. No idea if we’ve used them before but they do yellow and green 3m Cat6A patch leads. I guess we’d get them cheaper if we have a supplier who we use regularly?

 

Snip below and link here: https://www.fscables.com/products/3m-cat-6a-s-ftp-lshf-patch-lead.html <https://www.fscables.com/products/3m-cat-6a-s-ftp-lshf-patch-lead.html>

DTT only have stock of the line with qty 30 – the rest are not available until March.  They also have no stock of singles either.

Any ideas how we can sort this out or where else we can source them from?  Or is the wait OK?

Hi Lisa,

I'm told that there is a 6 to 8 week lead time for the AP-635s now. However, I'm speaking to the distributor to see if they can help out as it a relatively small number that you need.

Has the order for those been placed?

Thanks,

Kevin,

 

I tried to make it easier for you guys and put all the kit in their respective locations and I have made some errors, so that’s on me, apologies. I have corrected each line, and the support is for 1 year and I have marked that on the quote too. Did you have a chance to look at the professional services quote that I sent you too?

Hi David.

 

I have just been completing the order but noticed that we have difference in pricing for the same items in the quote. Can the quote be changed to reflect the cheaper price. 

 

I must admit not check every item yet.

Hi Kevin,

 

Further to our recent call regarding the EPVN expansion project, we have incorporated the agreed changes into the attached quote.

 

The updated kit list now includes the following to support the expansion of the campus fabric into Coach Lane:

 

*	Border Leaf, Spine, and Distribution Leaf Switches: Essential for the extended campus fabric.
*	Dedicated LAN-Side and WAN Aggregation Switches: Covering both Coach Lane and City Campus.
*	25Gb-ER Transceivers: Enabling backup site-to-site connectivity between City Campus, Coach Lane, and the Colo.
*	Spare Aruba 8325 (with Rack Kit): Included to facilitate the migration process.
*	Additional NetEdit Licenses: To manage the increased number of fabric switches.
*	 

Please review the attached quote at your convenience and let me know if you have any questions or require further adjustments. I look forward to your confirmation to proceed.

 

Thanks,

 

 

David Dunlop

Kevin,

 

I tried to make it easier for you guys and put all the kit in their respective locations and I have made some errors, so that’s on me, apologies. I have corrected each line, and the support is for 1 year and I have marked that on the quote too. Did you have a chance to look at the professional services quote that I sent you too?

 

Thanks,

Hi David,

 

This is a weird one…

 

Clacks renewed so late last year that the dates were change to end in May but the customers expiry date is Feb 2025. I have got a quote to co-term to their dates so they match up again.

 

Let me know if this is ok to send out or if you want me to amend?

Hi Stel,  

 

Hope you’re doing well! I’ve got a quick one for you regarding a customer query. Keele University has 12 AP585s (serials below) that are still boxed and unopened, and they’re asking if it’s possible to swap these for AP587s. Could you let me know:  

 

I appreciate they will be different values and possibly a restocking fee, but in principle are you able to help out? ?? 

 

Here are the serials:  

CNQGL1M02V  

CNQGL1M06H  

CNPSL1M01T  

CNQGL1M03Y  

CNQGL1M04D  

CNQGL1M06G  

CNQGL1M00G  

CNQGL1M06F  

CNQGL1M035  

CNQGL1M06L  

CNPSL1M01B  

CNQGL1M055  

 

Let me know if there is anything else that you needed from me.

 

Cheers,  

 

David

I haven't spoken to Mike yet, but I'm not sure what's happened with this one as I don't think I shared it with you yet? Unless I was speaking to Mike and he was thinking he could add it to your existing quotes?

Good morning David,

 

I have been passed your details by the Durham University’s CIS team.

 

We are working with the university to develop some new residential blocks, and I understand you work the university with regards to their designs for Wi-Fi heat maps etc.

 

Could we arrange a meeting to discuss what services you could support the project with?

 

Thanks,

 

Tim.

Hi David, 

We have 12 AP585's remaining that we would like to swap for AP587. Could you let us know how many AP587s we could get by returning these please?

These are the serial numbers:
CNQGL1M02V
CNQGL1M06H
CNPSL1M01T
CNQGL1M03Y
CNQGL1M04D
CNQGL1M06G
CNQGL1M00G
CNQGL1M06F
CNQGL1M035
CNQGL1M06L
CNPSL1M01B
CNQGL1M055

They are all still boxed and haven't been undone.

We are also looking for a couple of extra AP-270-MNT-H1 mounts. Could we get a price for these please?

Thanks,
Mat

Hi Stel,  

Hope you’re doing well! I’ve got a quick one for you regarding a customer query. Keele University has 12 AP585s (serials below) that are still boxed and unopened, and they’re asking if it’s possible to swap these for AP587s. Could you let me know:  

I appreciate they will be different values and possibly a restocking fee, but in principle are you able to help out? ?? 

Here are the serials:  
CNQGL1M02V  
CNQGL1M06H  
CNPSL1M01T  
CNQGL1M03Y

Let me know if there is anything else that you needed from me.

Morning David, 

Just emailing to see if the quote has come through for this request yet? We are now likely to require double the quantities originally requested but this will likely be placed via separate orders so the requested quote should be fine. 

Many Thanks,

Yeah 

Michael had asked me for a second option later on. Then he wanted changes to the 17058 etc, so I went through it with Mike yesterday to make sure we had the correct one. Michael got it wrong with the quote .... too many changes and opinions.

But .... The kit list is correct. I can redo it on the other quote number?

OK – that says it’s for QUO-17058 – but the kit list is right, even though it’s expired.  QUO-17058 is still live in Dynamics but has a different switch . . . . ?

Dylan,

 

As requested, please find your quote attached with the brackets removed.

 

P.S. I did notice when amending this that there were 146 brackets on here, however I should have quoted you 6 individual brackets and 14 packs of 10 which would have been a little cheaper.

Subject: Qolcom - Keele University - SFP Issue 

 

Mike, 

 

Mat has highlighted an issue with their J4858D SFPs. They’ve been troubleshooting low light levels on their fibre links and discovered they’ve got two versions of the transceivers under the same SKU:  

 

CN-prefixed - serials (e.g., CN06KC5NF6): These align with the expected 500m spec.  

MY-prefixed - serials (e.g., MY0BKBP5JT): These seem to max out at 300-330m.  

 

The fibre itself has been checked and is fine, so the shorter-range MY SFPs look to be the issue where installed.  

 

Any idea why there’s a difference between these two? Let me know if you've seen this before and what you think.

 

P.S. The order/quote for the kit in the tender for this SKU does specify 500m. I also had a Google regarding the serial numbers and apparently the prefix denotes the region of manufacture ... CN being China, and MY being Malaysia.

 

 

Cheers,

 

David

Subject: Example Plans



Hello mate,

 

Annual business plans attached.  These tend to be a bit individual i.e. people have their preferred format but really are based upon a few criteria.  What do you want to achieve, how are you going to do it and what do you need from the business to support you achieving it.  Everyone likes to look back to look forward but the first criteria are the most important. 

 

For any QBR’s we have a template which I’ve attached.  Again, I don’t need you to spend loads of time copying and pasting data that’s already in CRM, more what you want to achieve and what you need to do it.

 

Cheers

Jamie,


Thanks! Yes, we are aware of the issue. We requested Mat to log it with support as we suspect there will need to be an RMA, but at the very least have it recorded.

I have passed this onto Mike Sharwin and he's cc'd me into an email to some of his colleagues to see if it's a known issue.

When I find anything out I'll update you guys.

Cheers,

David

Original Description:

Hi, 

Speaking with David Dunlop, he's investigating this, but has asked me to also log it.

I do just need to raise another thing which has recently come to light, we've been looking at some low light levels on the halls kit, thinking it was a fibre fault, we've had that checked but in doing so we've noticed that we've got two different types of Multimode SFP under the SKU: J4858D. One is an MY and one is a CN serial number, the CN is a 500m SFP as per the specification when you search, the other is only a 300/330m SFP.

HPE Aruba Networking 1G SFP LC SX 500m OM2 MMF Transceiver

Attachments:	Qolocom - Clarifications and Unknowns.pdf

Hi Lisa,

 

I hope this email finds you well. Thank you again for providing the initial details and schematic for the IoT sensors and valves project. We’ve reviewed the information so far and compiled a document (attached) outlining key clarifications and unknowns that would help us align our proposal with your expectations.

 

Given the level of detail required to ensure the solution meets your needs, there are several areas where we would need additional input to proceed effectively. For example:

 

*	The interpretation of technical metrics like UL and DL in the schematic.
*	Confirmation on the specific locations and scope for sensor and valve installations.
*	Compliance considerations related to Legionella risk management and regulatory standards.
*	Integration details for the Daizy dashboard and notification configurations.

 

The document provides a comprehensive overview of the questions and clarifications required. However, given the volume of work still needed to finalize these details, we wanted to highlight that the timeline for providing a detailed and accurate quote by Friday may be challenging. If much of this information is readily available, we would be happy to work with you to address these points as quickly as possible. Alternatively, if the timeline allows for further discussions or a site survey to validate assumptions, we would be more than happy to assist in creating a proposal that aligns fully with your requirements.

 

Please let me know your thoughts on how you’d like to proceed, and whether additional time or collaboration might be possible to ensure we can deliver the best solution for this project.

 

Looking forward to hearing from you.

 

Regards,

 

David Dunlop

Subject:	Qolcom - Keele University - SFP Issue 

Mike,

Mat has highlighted an issue with their J4858D SFPs. They’ve been troubleshooting low light levels on their fibre links and discovered they’ve got two versions of the transceivers under the same SKU:  

CN-prefixed - serials (e.g., CN06KC5NF6): These align with the expected 500m spec.  
MY-prefixed - serials (e.g., MY0BKBP5JT): These seem to max out at 300-330m.  

The fibre itself has been checked and is fine, so the shorter-range MY SFPs look to be the issue where installed.  

Any idea why there’s a difference between these two? Let me know if you've seen this before and what you think.

P.S. The order/quote for the kit in the tender for this SKU does specify 500m. I also had a Google regarding the serial numbers and apparently the prefix denotes the region of manufacture ... CN being China, and MY being Malaysia.


Cheers,

David

Hi Kevin,

 

Further to our recent call regarding the EPVN expansion project, we have incorporated the agreed changes into the attached quote.

 

The updated kit list now includes the following to support the expansion of the campus fabric into Coach Lane:

 

*	Border Leaf, Spine, and Distribution Leaf Switches: Essential for the extended campus fabric.
*	Dedicated LAN-Side and WAN Aggregation Switches: Covering both Coach Lane and City Campus.
*	25Gb-ER Transceivers: Enabling backup site-to-site connectivity between City Campus, Coach Lane, and the Colo.
*	Spare Aruba 8325 (with Rack Kit): Included to facilitate the migration process.
*	Additional NetEdit Licenses: To manage the increased number of fabric switches.
*	 

Please review the attached quote at your convenience and let me know if you have any questions or require further adjustments. I look forward to your confirmation to proceed.

 

Thanks,

Subject:	RE: Qolcom - Bechtle

Hi Stewart,

 

Great to hear from you—it really has been a while! I hope all’s good with you. The network roll-out sounds like a big deal—I’m sure it’ll be worth it in the end, but I can imagine the chaos just now. Hopefully, it all goes smoothly!

 

The Bechtle thing has been a big change for us, although not much change day to day yet, but it does give us a much bigger portfolio and access to expertise, and I won’t lie—pronouncing it took a bit of practice for me too. ??(It is “Bek-lu”, apparently it is a silent t) Being part of the group has opened up a lot of doors for us, which is why we were keen to explore the VM tender opportunity.

 

It’s not the type of position we are normally in when looking to bid as we weren’t involved at all, so just wanted to see if there was any scope to join the race. I think we will leave this one for now, and keep my eyes peeled for other projects.

 

I appreciate it is a busy time at the moment, but if there is anything I can help with just let me know, and in the meantime, we can look at arranging a call when you are free and I can let you know what’s been happening here and vice versa.

 

 

Take care and speak soon,

 

 

David Dunlop

Hi David,

 

It has been a while! Hope all is good with you.

 

The acquisition is interesting although I’m not exactly sure how to pronounce Bechtle. ??

 

To be honest I don’t know if the servers and storage guys have a preferred option to replace the current infrastructure with. I’ve been buried under my own stuff and haven’t been involved with the tender process. I am now having to start answering network related questions from tender responses though.

 

I’m struggling for space next week as we are about to embark on the roll-out of the new network infrastructure on the Edinburgh campus.

 

Hopefully catch up soon though.

Morning Stewart,

 

Long time no speak! I hope you and the team are well. ??

 

I wanted to catch up with you on some changes here, as we are now part of the Bechtle group. As part of this acquisition, it means we are suddenly a much larger organisation, with a much wider portfolio and team of skills and expertise.

 

Since then we have been working on a number of wider projects with Bechtle UK and this week we discussed the possibility of responding to the VM tender at the University. I have a call with the guys this morning about that, however before I do I was wondering if you guys had any notion of what you want to replace the current infrastructure or if it is genuinely open to see what the responses bring?

 

If you have some time next week it would be great to catch up and let you know a bit more about the acquisition and what it means.

 

Speak soon,

 

David

Hi David,

I think this was the one for the network switch that we did through the credit.

 

If it saves you some effort you could just resend that with an updated date, or is that just muddying the waters?

Alan,

 

Here is your quote for the switch. I should point out though that I was expecting slightly more discount than we got, so I have asked for it to be escalated and should receive that back by tomorrow. 

However, it has taken a bit longer than usual, so I thought best to send you what we have just now in case you need to get moving on it. Also, I have included a power supply as that will be needed for this switch.

 

Let me know if there is anything else that you need.

 

P.S. If I get improved pricing back, I will share it with you regardless, but if you need to order straight away I will take the difference off of the order for Colin, so you still pay the same if that makes sense.

 

Thanks,

Hi Lars,

 

I hope this email finds you well.

 

We’ve been discussing a potential pilot of Blyott’s solution for a university customer, Keele University, and I’d like to request a formal quote based on their outlined requirements. Below is a summary of the customer’s needs and expectations for the pilot:

 

 

Customer Requirements:

1.	Use Cases:

	*	Key Tracking: Attach compact tags to track high-value keys across the campus.
	*	Library Book Tagging: Utilize sticker tags to track high-value library books, ensuring they are not removed from the library.

2.	Tracking Accuracy:

	*	Room-level or approximate location accuracy is sufficient (GPS-level precision is not required).

3.	Initial Scale for Pilot:

	*	Tracking for 10–20 keys as a starting point.
	*	Potential to scale based on success and further requirements.

4.	Existing Infrastructure:

	*	Aruba Wi-Fi infrastructure is already in place and will be used for BLE functionality.

5.	Tags and Suggestions:

	*	Sticker tags for library books.
	*	Standard tags with 3D keyrings for keys.

 

 

Could you please provide:

*	A quote for a pilot package tailored to these use cases and initial scale.
*	Details about any minimum order quantities (e.g., 100+ tags) or subscription requirements (e.g., 250 tags MOQ).
*	Options for a demo kit and associated costs, if applicable.

 

If you require additional information to finalize the quote, feel free to let me know. Once we have the quote, I’ll share it with the customer for further discussion.

Hi Nick,

 

As promised, we're getting back to you regarding the pricing model for XPO, and after briefly discussing with Gery & Nicolas, given the size of this opportunity, we propose limiting your discount to 20% and also reducing Ingram's discount to offer the most competitive price to the end client, hoping to secure this deal as a reference for future projects, a strategy that has proven successful in the past with other "moonshot" deals.

We have constructed a model with volume discounts, all-inclusive prices combining hardware and subscriptions/licenses, offering a Capex model for a one-off all-in payment.

 

Please find below the volume discounts that will be applied for this deal:
* Notes

*These discounts are discounts "on top of" the standard reseller discount (20% in this case);
*Volume discounts should be fully passed on to the customer.

 

*	Price per ARUBA environment (location): €1.500 list price (one time)

	*	Extra discount for locations:

		*	5 = 10%
		*	10 = 20%
		*	25 = 25%
		*	50 = 30%
		*	100 = 40%

*	Price per mobile locator (incl. 4G LTE Data subscription)

	*	Hardware + 3-year data 4G/LTE sub. = 300€
	*	Hardware + 5-year data 4G/LTE sub. = 400€

Additionally, we've added a suggestive quote with approximate numbers as we do not know the specific figures yet.
(Based on 100 Aruba locations, 300 mobile locators & 50.000 tags - subscriptions for 36m).

*On the Total Contract Value Qolcom’s reseller discount will be applied @20% = €174.200

* Price for the customer per tag per month "all-in" over 36 months = ~ €0.5/tag/month (or approximately €18/tag over 36 months)

 

Please let me know if there are any questions or any specific numbers for an official quotation based on the exact numbers demanded.

Hi David,

 

Yes sounds good (the review, not the £50k ??). I might wish to include Alan (on my side) if it’s just as much (or more) about the money side of things, rather than on the technical side.

 

Thursdays and Fridays are my most available days over the next month. Feel free to suggest some dates.

 

Thanks,

Colin

Hi Colin,

 

Yes . . . I did, but it was very general due to a number of factors. Kelly got back to me late on Friday to say that it will be about £50k.

 

However, it is probably a good idea to arrange a call to review that and see what if anything can be done to impact that annually? For example, look at a few areas that will possibly affect licenses? We can look at current vs AOS10 Cloud comparisons too?

Whilst we can't get an official quote from Aruba we can still put together the renewal and possibly use a percentage increase to cover.

Hi David,

 

Is it too late for Happy New Year? Probably. Anyway…

 

We are currently looking at our budgets for 25/26 and are being asked for estimates. I realise that we are 9 months away from the actual renewal and things could change, but would it be possible to get an estimated cost at this stage for this year’s Aruba support renewal to allow budget planning?

Hi David,

Yeah good to go mate, likewise I’m pretty sure we have the credit to cover this.

 

Are we able to retrospectively issue a quote for that list so I can get a PO raised against it to bring the credit pot back up to correct level?

 

I would have done it through a PO originally and only used the credit on the basis I didn’t think we’d be able to order other kit, so the credit pot gives me more flexibility.

Alan,

 

Attached is your quote for the AV kit you were looking for. I have asked Heidi what you will be left with after this order is placed but unfortunately, she is at a funeral today. However, you do have enough in credit to cover this kit I just don’t know how much yet.

 

Do you want me to go ahead and get this ordered? I just need an email confirmation either way.

Good morning David,

 

I have been passed your details by the Durham University’s CIS team.

 

We are working with the university to develop some new residential blocks, and I understand you work the university with regards to their designs for Wi-Fi heat maps etc.

 

Could we arrange a meeting to discuss what services you could support the project with?

 

Thanks,

 

Tim.

Hi David,

 

I hope you are well and happy new year.

I am renewing some Aruba central licenses and wondered if you would quote on the following:

14 x Q9Y70AAE - Aruba Central Class 1 Foundation Switch Licence – 5 year
56 x Q9Y75AAE - Aruba Central Class 2 Foundation Switch Licence – 5 year

 

Any queries please let me know.

Please could you provide us a quote for some extra AP's for Boldon House as below:

8 x AP-635
1 x AP-565 (external)
1 x right-angle bracket kit for AP-565

The building is due to be completed in the next month or so - time is of the essence with these if you don't mind! ??

Morning Stewart,

Long time no speak! I hope you and the team are well. ??

I wanted to catch up with you on some changes here, as we are now part of the Bechtle group. As part of this acquisition, it means we are suddenly a much larger organisation, with a much wider portfolio and team of skills and expertise.

Since then we have been working on a number of wider projects with Bechtle UK and this week we discussed the possibility of responding to the VM tender at the University. I have a call with the guys this morning about that, however before I do I was wondering if you guys had any notion of what you want to replace the current infrastructure or if it is genuinely open to see what the responses bring?

If you have some time next week it would be great to catch up and let you know a bit more about the acquisition and what it means.

Speak soon,

David

It’s over 6 months out so can’t get an official quote just yet.

 

The previous renewal had a discount on due to the increased cost with Airwave so we can’t 100% say we will get that again and we’ve also just added more kit to it that will renew in the term. 

 

But based on the previous contracts I would say a figure of 50k for budgetary purposes. 

 

I can get a confirmed figure in April.

Hi Kelly,

 

Colin has asked if he can get an estimated cost for their aruba support renewal? They are looking at budgets and this is the last year of our framework with them and EE.

Hi David,


Yes, we have a relationship with Herriott Watt which we’ve had for many years.  David Dunlop, in copy will be able to provide additional detail, but this tender could be an opportunity to expand upon the relationship.

Happy to yes, is there an existing relationship on Qolcom side @Ben Reynish <mailto:breynish@qolcom.co.uk>  with the customer itself?

 

Good to give it a go if we have an angle, but would maybe pass on it as a cold tender if not.

Hey DG, 

 

Hope you had a good time on Friday!

 

Qolcom have visibility of a virtualisation tender for Heriot-Watt University. Ben has suggested Bechtle front the tender leveraging Qolcom’s existing relationship, if we wish to BID, however I can’t see that there is an AM aligned to the account currently. 

 

Would you be happy to align Heriot-Watt University to someone in your team, and if we’re in agreement, register interest to the tender. Ben/David Dunlop should be able to advise where this will be.

 

Kind Regards

What is the portal quote ref for this?  The only one that I can see (of which there have been many versions) is NQ07996121.  However your quote has three different SFPs (2 of which are not on this quote) and the other one has insufficient quantities

Hi David,

 

Mike has said that he can’t see any kit in this quote but it shows our side so must be a problem with their portal.

 

It’s with him to sort.

Alan,

 

Attached is your quote for the AV kit you were looking for. I have asked Heidi what you will be left with after this order is placed but unfortunately, she is at a funeral today. However, you do have enough in credit to cover this kit I just don’t know how much yet.

 

Do you want me to go ahead and get this ordered? I just need an email confirmation either way.

Thanks,

Hi David,


Yes, we have a relationship with Herriott Watt which we’ve had for many years.  David Dunlop, in copy will be able to provide additional detail, but this tender could be an opportunity to expand upon the relationship.

 

Thanks

Happy to yes, is there an existing relationship on Qolcom side @Ben Reynish <mailto:breynish@qolcom.co.uk>  with the customer itself?

 

Good to give it a go if we have an angle, but would maybe pass on it as a cold tender if not.

 

Thanks,
David

Hey DG, 

 

Hope you had a good time on Friday!

 

Qolcom have visibility of a virtualisation tender for Heriot-Watt University. Ben has suggested Bechtle front the tender leveraging Qolcom’s existing relationship, if we wish to BID, however I can’t see that there is an AM aligned to the account currently. 

 

Would you be happy to align Heriot-Watt University to someone in your team, and if we’re in agreement, register interest to the tender. Ben/David Dunlop should be able to advise where this will be.

 

Kind Regards

What is the portal quote ref for this?  The only one that I can see (of which there have been many versions) is NQ07996121.  However your quote has three different SFPs (2 of which are not on this quote) and the other one has insufficient quantities

Alan,

 

A belated happy new year to you too! I think the less we say about the fitba the better . . . we have went downhill fast after beating you guys!

 

I have received the part numbers today, so we will be adding lots more in the coming months. I am just waiting for the part numbers to be added to the system and then I will get the quote over to you. It will be about £680 ex vat for the items but I’ll get the quote done as soon the part numbers are on the system.

 

I’ll be in touch tomorrow.

Hi David,

Happy New Year to you mate, hopefully a better one for both our teams!

 

Any joy with procuring the receiver/transmitter at all?

 

Happy to have a quick catchup re this and whether or not we can increase the credit level again by paying for that last switch, appreciate that might complicate things for you so worth a quick call.

Hi David,

Re below, if you are now able to get the AV stuff then the following should be doable with the remaining credit balance:

 

TP-583Rxr 4K HDR HDMI Receiver with RS–232 & IR over Extended–Reach HDBaseT (kramerav.com) <https://www1.kramerav.com/product/TP-583Rxr> 
TP-583Txr 4K HDR HDMI Transmitter with RS–232 & IR over Extended–Reach HDBaseT (kramerav.com) <https://www1.kramerav.com/product/TP-583Txr> 

 

Let me know if that’s ok and, that being the case I might get you to issue a formal quote for the switch you already provided. I could then raise a PO against that so the credit comes back for other AV kit.

 

Not sure if that get’s too complicated but we can discuss.

Alan,

 

Regardless of what was left or not . . . did you have plans for what remaining money you thought you had? Happy to help with whatever you need?

 

Also, since we were acquired . . . (I will speak to you in detail about it, but it is all positive), we are now able to assist with much more, and one thing that came to my attention was AV equipment that you’d asked me about before. I will arrange a call and do this properly but thought I’d make you aware.

 

If there is anything that you were looking to buy with the outstanding money let me know and I’ll see what we can do.

 

Thanks,

Alan,

 

Bets aside . . . I think we have uncovered the difference. It is EE . . .

 

When I asked Heidi to reconcile the documents she said it wouldn’t be easy as each of those has to go via EE. So it looks like the difference from the original amount is the percentage that EE take.

 

Not the answer you wanted but I think this has been the issue.

 

Thanks,

Alan,

 

We had a bet that St Mirren would beat Aberdeen! ??

 

I'm messing, of course Alan, I'll send your email over to Heidi in customer services as she had been keeping tabs on the credit and we can compare both and see where any differences are.

 

Thanks,

Hi David,

Just got around to doing a quick reconcile on that credit spend, I think we have a bit more in the pot than the £1,169.58 based on the following breakdown (all my calculations are Inc VAT):

 

Starting Balance               £11,688.31

July Spend                         -£  5,767.93
December Spend           -£  3,897.16

Remaining Balance        £  2,023.22

 

Can you review and revert please, I can dig out the quotes if you need them.

 

Ta

Alan,

 

I think I got too excited about our recent win . . . and then haven’t won since, that I forgot to hit send! Please see below the remaining balance after the 2930 switch has been invoiced . . . 

 

The balance remaining on this PO is now £1,169.58.

Alan,

 

Here is your quote for the switch. I should point out though that I was expecting slightly more discount than we got, so I have asked for it to be escalated and should receive that back by tomorrow. 

However, it has taken a bit longer than usual, so I thought best to send you what we have just now in case you need to get moving on it. Also, I have included a power supply as that will be needed for this switch.

 

Let me know if there is anything else that you need.

 

P.S. If I get improved pricing back, I will share it with you regardless, but if you need to order straight away I will take the difference off of the order for Colin, so you still pay the same if that makes sense.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

Good afternoon, I got your contact information from the Crown Commercial Services RM6116 contract.  I am looking for a quotation for the supply and implementation of IoT water temperature sensors and remote flushing valves for one of our buildings and wondered if this is something you would be able to supply.  

 

If you are able to supply this type of device I would be grateful if you could get in touch before Friday 17th January to discuss.

Hi David,

 

Is it too late for Happy New Year? Probably. Anyway…

 

We are currently looking at our budgets for 25/26 and are being asked for estimates. I realise that we are 9 months away from the actual renewal and things could change, but would it be possible to get an estimated cost at this stage for this year’s Aruba support renewal to allow budget planning?

Glen, I can confirm that the order for the access points will get you 33 credits. The remaining credits are split between the access layer, and the missing support items and CoP license quotes.

There will be 100 training credits in total.

 

Please let me know when you are looking at placing the orders as Mike has to do a few things in the background to make sure you get your credits.

 

Thanks,

Hi Simon,

 

Sorry I missed this earlier today somehow.

 

I have added an 8360 to represent colo BL into the LAB.

 

In summary, it seems to all work fine. I have had cross site pings between L3VNI and L2VNI clients whilst connected at Colo-BL, CC-DL and CL-DL. Also done some link failure testing and that was solid – interesting with the eBGP multihop setting that we are retaining BGP sessions between CC-BL and CL-BL when we drop the physically attached link between them as it just re-routes via Colo – if we intend to retain this aspect I can’t particularly think of a downside.

 

Our gremlin was Microsoft Windows firewall on clients allowing ICMP inbound from it’s subnet but not from outside, so as we thought, the EVPN was good and thankfully this was nothing to do with the 6300 ??

 

I do need to add your user in to the 8360s, I’ll get that sorted tomorrow, for now I have attached all the config (excluding INET switch which I haven’t got round to connecting to new BLs) and thrown in a diagram I was using to keep tabs on interfaces on new hardware.

 

Many thanks,

David

Good morning,

 

Happy new year to you all! 

 

Thanks for the update David. I do recall reading a section in the guide around the supported platform for the Border VTEP / Border Leader roles within a multi-fabric solution, snippet below:

 

Supported platform

The EVPN VXLAN multi-fabric solution is supported only with the 8325 and 10000* Switch Series as a

border-leader VTEP.

Border VTEPs (but non-border-leaders) that support this solution include the 8325, 8360, and 10000

Switch Series.

Non-border VTEPS that support this solution include the 6300, 6400, 8325, 8360, 8400, and 10000 Switch

Series.

For the 10000 Switch series, a firewall policy is not supported when the switch is acting as a border-VTEP or

border-leader.

 

As you can see in the notes above the 6300 is not listed as a supported platform for both the Border Leader and Border VTEP roles, however, as is quite often the case this does not mean that it will now work, more so that it has not been validated by HPE. Though it would seem in this case the functionality required at this layer in the fabric is not supported by the hardware... I would need HPE to confirm that 100% though....

 

In terms on the product selection for the end design we are good as we have positioned 8325's here.

 

If you could please send me the updated configs for the border VTEPs so i can review the changes to BGP and Route Targets that would be appreciated!

 

Many thanks,

Simon

Hi all,

 

Right today has been interesting.

 

I have used some 8360s to create CC to CL BL peerings in place of the 6300. This has allowed be to issue the evpn command for disabling split horizon for the vtep from iBGP to eBGP.

 

I have adjusted the RTs, such that iBGP uses auto derived for import/export and eBGP will use manually configured RT – this is working fine.

 

I have next-hop-self toward the iBGP environment for L2VPN routes learnt from eBGP peer.

 

We do now have the data plane VXLAN tunnels working cross site (apparently our design is still a single fabric but considered multi-site).

 

L2VNI all good

 

L3VNI sort of good, works between loopbacks and clients can reach the remote site – same issue as yesterday. I’m almost 100% that this is a 6300M routing issue and nothing to do with our EVPN constructs. I have taken a vanilla 6300M out of stock and created 2 SVIs and connected the clients to each. Only the direct VLAN SVI on the switch can ping a client in its VLAN (SVI 100 can ping access vlan 100 client, SVI 200 can ping access vlan 200 client) – but it is not possible for SVI 200 to ping access vlan 100 client (routed internally by the switch – this is crazy and must surely be the most basic problem to solve yet I’m giving up now – the documentation I have for 6300M devices on 10.13 does not match fully the config options I see. The clients could not ping each other on this vanilla out of the box switch.

 

So, in summary – I think we’re almost there – but we do need to introduce another 8360 (which we can do in New Year) to take place of the Colo BL – to make sure we’re controlling routes etc.

 

Have a great Christmas & New Year,

Simon,

 

We can both access the guide, we are in a better place after the changes, but we have one issue we haven’t worked out yet, was hoping to find it in the doc, or config.

 

We are trying to get a ping reply using the laptops in Vlan 100 from CC-DL TO CL-DL 10.100.2.10 to 10.100.4.10, but doesn’t work.

 

Strange thing is both laptops can hit the gateway 10.100.2.254 and 10.100.4.254 in the remote DL but not the Laptop.

pcap

 



 

I’m off tomorrow back in on the 3rd Jan, David is going to have a look tomorrow and he’s back in on 2nd Jan.

 

Happy xmas and happy new year

Hi all,

 

I have been skimming through the configuration guide for VXLAN-EVPN and Chapter 6 contains various examples of multi-fabric solutions which utilise a single ASN per-fabric, which is essentially what we are trying to do. The configuration guide can be accessed here:

 

https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/AOS-CX/10.14/PDF/vxlan.pdf <https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/AOS-CX/10.14/PDF/vxlan.pdf> 

 

Let me know if you can't access the guide and I will put it in Kiteworks as it is too large to attach.

 

I think with the recent changes that David has made we are not far off, however, I think some work around route-targets and route-maps will be required so that only the border VTEPs are in a full-mesh configuration instead of all VTEPs across the fabrics.

 

I am back in on the 2nd so if we can pick this up again then that would be great.

 

I hope you all have a good Xmas and New Year.

 

Regards,

Simon

Thanks David.

 

Please can you send me a capture of the latest configs so that I can see the changes you have made. I think you a right, we do not want a full-mesh between all leafs across fabrics, the tunnel should only be between the two borders. That is where i believe the command "dyn-vxlan-tunnel-bridging-mode ibgp-ebgp" should come in.

 

I will see if I can find anything else in the documentation, I will also send a summary of what has been setup, tested etc to the SE at HPE that I was working with, though I suspect I won't get a response now until after the Xmas break.

 

On the L3VNI side, I had the virtual-mac configured in the VSX setup at HPE but must have missed it when I was putting the scripts together so apologies for that! Are you able to now route between all of the locally-defined networks on the leafs vis the L3VNI?

 

Thanks,

Simon

L2 pings work on VLAN 300 below cross fabric



 

but this isn’t the right approach for cross-fabric VXLAN tunnels as we’ll end up with a mesh between leafs across fabrics – was speaking to Kev last week about the DCI connect approach between fabrics

I may have had an epiphany, if I have we can put it down to Sierra Nevada California IPA.

 

With cross fabric Layer 2 the config is currently set within EVPN to auto derive the route target. VLAN 200 is our focus.



 

 

What that means is this:



 

And because the other side of our fabric is a different BGP AS, also with auto derived Route Targets, then perhaps although the route is there, it is not really being imported  as the RT does not match for evpn on the other side (even though the MAC is in BGP).

 

So, given the cross campus didn’t work on VLAN 200, I have configured this:



 

We now have a manually defined RT of 300:300. Which gives:



 



On Monday we can try interface 1/1/6 of each DL over Layer 2.

 

Many thanks,

David

Afternoon all,

 

I have tried to make some progress with our lab environment today.

 

I’ve had some success with the L3VNI traffic, but ran out of time to look at L2VNI – I did a couple of tests with L2VNI with a client in 1/1/5 of CC-BL and CL-BL, no joy, but between CL-DL and CL-BL the L2VNI was successful.

 

For L3VNI I’ll try and recall what I’ve done before the weekend as I will forget!

 

[1] I’ve added a virtual-mac to the configurations

*	Without this L3VNI pings between CC-DL & CC-BL were not successful
*	I believe this relates to asymmetric IRB

 

[2] I’ve made the underlay visible throughout by redistributing the bgp IPv4 family used between border leafs into OSPF at each fabric

*	Seemed to be required as the BGP config is not next-hop self toward own AS devices and DLs had no path to the next hop on L2VPN EVPN RT 5, e.g. CL-BL loopback 0 was next hop but no path to it on CC-DL
*	As a fun gotcha, the interfaces that face the Borderleafs were added the ip ospf 1 area 0 command, so that OSPF would know about the underlay link which is used only for BGP

 

[3] I’ve added a BGP command to the L2VPN family at the BLs (eBGP) to prevent the default eBGP behaviour of modifying next hop – this was required for cross fabric ping for VRF campus

*	Next-hop-unchanged was added to L2VPN at BLs but not toward Spines

 

[4] I did redistribute local loopbacks for the DLs within the VRF campus, these interfaces I used for end to end tests

 



 

 

Many thanks

 

David

Simon,

 

I’ve connected the switches up, first put the underlay and tested connections.. all ok.

 

I’ve also added on the overlay and config for NU-WAN-INT.

NU-WAN-INT, physical connections are on int 1/1/6, on borders.

 

Waiting for new VPN account, ill send details when we have account and vpn ready.

 

Haven’t checked overlay or NU-WAN-INT yet, or test pc’s, thought get all on line with access and configs.

Good afternoon gents.

 

I have put together a Visio diagram and have produced initial configuration scripts for the EVPN test rig we discussed setting up on Friday last week, these are in the attached zip file.

 

For this build you will need a minimum of eight HPE Aruba 6300M 48G switches. I have nominated which interfaces should be used on the diagram as these relate to specific config in the scripts. I have built the scripts manually so apologies if there are any typos or incorrect syntax.

 

In each of the scripts there is a few lines of config for the out of band management port, you will need to assign an IP address to each switch and configure it with the associated gateway IP so that the rig can be accessed remotely.

 

This should at the very least give you a good starting point but if you have any questions or problems please give me a shout.

 

Thanks,

 

Simon Williams

Hi all,

 

Attached are the updated elements to integrate the NU-INT-WAN 6300 into the test fabric.

 

Couple of minor tweaks, interfaces used and introduction of default-originate in BGP from the INT switch.

 

Cheers,

Hi Simon,

 

Sorry I missed this earlier today somehow.

 

I have added an 8360 to represent colo BL into the LAB.

 

In summary, it seems to all work fine. I have had cross site pings between L3VNI and L2VNI clients whilst connected at Colo-BL, CC-DL and CL-DL. Also done some link failure testing and that was solid – interesting with the eBGP multihop setting that we are retaining BGP sessions between CC-BL and CL-BL when we drop the physically attached link between them as it just re-routes via Colo – if we intend to retain this aspect I can’t particularly think of a downside.

 

Our gremlin was Microsoft Windows firewall on clients allowing ICMP inbound from it’s subnet but not from outside, so as we thought, the EVPN was good and thankfully this was nothing to do with the 6300 ??

 

I do need to add your user in to the 8360s, I’ll get that sorted tomorrow, for now I have attached all the config (excluding INET switch which I haven’t got round to connecting to new BLs) and thrown in a diagram I was using to keep tabs on interfaces on new hardware.

 

Many thanks,

David

Good morning,

 

Happy new year to you all! 

 

Thanks for the update David. I do recall reading a section in the guide around the supported platform for the Border VTEP / Border Leader roles within a multi-fabric solution, snippet below:

 

Supported platform

The EVPN VXLAN multi-fabric solution is supported only with the 8325 and 10000* Switch Series as a

border-leader VTEP.

Border VTEPs (but non-border-leaders) that support this solution include the 8325, 8360, and 10000

Switch Series.

Non-border VTEPS that support this solution include the 6300, 6400, 8325, 8360, 8400, and 10000 Switch

Series.

For the 10000 Switch series, a firewall policy is not supported when the switch is acting as a border-VTEP or

border-leader.

 

As you can see in the notes above the 6300 is not listed as a supported platform for both the Border Leader and Border VTEP roles, however, as is quite often the case this does not mean that it will now work, more so that it has not been validated by HPE. Though it would seem in this case the functionality required at this layer in the fabric is not supported by the hardware... I would need HPE to confirm that 100% though....

 

In terms on the product selection for the end design we are good as we have positioned 8325's here.

 

If you could please send me the updated configs for the border VTEPs so i can review the changes to BGP and Route Targets that would be appreciated!

 

Many thanks,

Simon

Hi all,

 

Right today has been interesting.

 

I have used some 8360s to create CC to CL BL peerings in place of the 6300. This has allowed be to issue the evpn command for disabling split horizon for the vtep from iBGP to eBGP.

 

I have adjusted the RTs, such that iBGP uses auto derived for import/export and eBGP will use manually configured RT – this is working fine.

 

I have next-hop-self toward the iBGP environment for L2VPN routes learnt from eBGP peer.

 

We do now have the data plane VXLAN tunnels working cross site (apparently our design is still a single fabric but considered multi-site).

 

L2VNI all good

 

L3VNI sort of good, works between loopbacks and clients can reach the remote site – same issue as yesterday. I’m almost 100% that this is a 6300M routing issue and nothing to do with our EVPN constructs. I have taken a vanilla 6300M out of stock and created 2 SVIs and connected the clients to each. Only the direct VLAN SVI on the switch can ping a client in its VLAN (SVI 100 can ping access vlan 100 client, SVI 200 can ping access vlan 200 client) – but it is not possible for SVI 200 to ping access vlan 100 client (routed internally by the switch – this is crazy and must surely be the most basic problem to solve yet I’m giving up now – the documentation I have for 6300M devices on 10.13 does not match fully the config options I see. The clients could not ping each other on this vanilla out of the box switch.

 

So, in summary – I think we’re almost there – but we do need to introduce another 8360 (which we can do in New Year) to take place of the Colo BL – to make sure we’re controlling routes etc.

 

Have a great Christmas & New Year,

Simon,

 

We can both access the guide, we are in a better place after the changes, but we have one issue we haven’t worked out yet, was hoping to find it in the doc, or config.

 

We are trying to get a ping reply using the laptops in Vlan 100 from CC-DL TO CL-DL 10.100.2.10 to 10.100.4.10, but doesn’t work.

 

Strange thing is both laptops can hit the gateway 10.100.2.254 and 10.100.4.254 in the remote DL but not the Laptop.

pcap

 



 

I’m off tomorrow back in on the 3rd Jan, David is going to have a look tomorrow and he’s back in on 2nd Jan.

 

Happy xmas and happy new year

 

Len

Hi all,

 

I have been skimming through the configuration guide for VXLAN-EVPN and Chapter 6 contains various examples of multi-fabric solutions which utilise a single ASN per-fabric, which is essentially what we are trying to do. The configuration guide can be accessed here:

 

https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/AOS-CX/10.14/PDF/vxlan.pdf <https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/AOS-CX/10.14/PDF/vxlan.pdf> 

 

Let me know if you can't access the guide and I will put it in Kiteworks as it is too large to attach.

 

I think with the recent changes that David has made we are not far off, however, I think some work around route-targets and route-maps will be required so that only the border VTEPs are in a full-mesh configuration instead of all VTEPs across the fabrics.

 

I am back in on the 2nd so if we can pick this up again then that would be great.

 

I hope you all have a good Xmas and New Year.

 

Regards,

Simon

Thanks David.

 

Please can you send me a capture of the latest configs so that I can see the changes you have made. I think you a right, we do not want a full-mesh between all leafs across fabrics, the tunnel should only be between the two borders. That is where i believe the command "dyn-vxlan-tunnel-bridging-mode ibgp-ebgp" should come in.

 

I will see if I can find anything else in the documentation, I will also send a summary of what has been setup, tested etc to the SE at HPE that I was working with, though I suspect I won't get a response now until after the Xmas break.

 

On the L3VNI side, I had the virtual-mac configured in the VSX setup at HPE but must have missed it when I was putting the scripts together so apologies for that! Are you able to now route between all of the locally-defined networks on the leafs vis the L3VNI?

 

Thanks,

Simon

L2 pings work on VLAN 300 below cross fabric



 

but this isn’t the right approach for cross-fabric VXLAN tunnels as we’ll end up with a mesh between leafs across fabrics – was speaking to Kev last week about the DCI connect approach between fabrics

 

Thanks,

David

I may have had an epiphany, if I have we can put it down to Sierra Nevada California IPA.

 

With cross fabric Layer 2 the config is currently set within EVPN to auto derive the route target. VLAN 200 is our focus.



 

 

What that means is this:



 

And because the other side of our fabric is a different BGP AS, also with auto derived Route Targets, then perhaps although the route is there, it is not really being imported  as the RT does not match for evpn on the other side (even though the MAC is in BGP).

 

So, given the cross campus didn’t work on VLAN 200, I have configured this:



 

We now have a manually defined RT of 300:300. Which gives:



 



On Monday we can try interface 1/1/6 of each DL over Layer 2.

 

Many thanks,

David

Afternoon all,

 

I have tried to make some progress with our lab environment today.

 

I’ve had some success with the L3VNI traffic, but ran out of time to look at L2VNI – I did a couple of tests with L2VNI with a client in 1/1/5 of CC-BL and CL-BL, no joy, but between CL-DL and CL-BL the L2VNI was successful.

 

For L3VNI I’ll try and recall what I’ve done before the weekend as I will forget!

 

[1] I’ve added a virtual-mac to the configurations

*	Without this L3VNI pings between CC-DL & CC-BL were not successful
*	I believe this relates to asymmetric IRB

 

[2] I’ve made the underlay visible throughout by redistributing the bgp IPv4 family used between border leafs into OSPF at each fabric

*	Seemed to be required as the BGP config is not next-hop self toward own AS devices and DLs had no path to the next hop on L2VPN EVPN RT 5, e.g. CL-BL loopback 0 was next hop but no path to it on CC-DL
*	As a fun gotcha, the interfaces that face the Borderleafs were added the ip ospf 1 area 0 command, so that OSPF would know about the underlay link which is used only for BGP

 

[3] I’ve added a BGP command to the L2VPN family at the BLs (eBGP) to prevent the default eBGP behaviour of modifying next hop – this was required for cross fabric ping for VRF campus

*	Next-hop-unchanged was added to L2VPN at BLs but not toward Spines

 

[4] I did redistribute local loopbacks for the DLs within the VRF campus, these interfaces I used for end to end tests

 



 

 

Many thanks

 

David

I’ve connected the switches up, first put the underlay and tested connections.. all ok.

 

I’ve also added on the overlay and config for NU-WAN-INT.

NU-WAN-INT, physical connections are on int 1/1/6, on borders.

 

Waiting for new VPN account, ill send details when we have account and vpn ready.

 

Haven’t checked overlay or NU-WAN-INT yet, or test pc’s, thought get all on line with access and configs.

Good afternoon gents.

 

I have put together a Visio diagram and have produced initial configuration scripts for the EVPN test rig we discussed setting up on Friday last week, these are in the attached zip file.

 

For this build you will need a minimum of eight HPE Aruba 6300M 48G switches. I have nominated which interfaces should be used on the diagram as these relate to specific config in the scripts. I have built the scripts manually so apologies if there are any typos or incorrect syntax.

 

In each of the scripts there is a few lines of config for the out of band management port, you will need to assign an IP address to each switch and configure it with the associated gateway IP so that the rig can be accessed remotely.

 

This should at the very least give you a good starting point but if you have any questions or problems please give me a shout.

 

Thanks,

 

Simon Williams

Please can arrange a meeting to catchup on where we are with the fabric testing and design. 

 

Also have you had any progress on your VPN access ? 

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Hi all,

 

Attached are the updated elements to integrate the NU-INT-WAN 6300 into the test fabric.

 

Couple of minor tweaks, interfaces used and introduction of default-originate in BGP from the INT switch.

 

Cheers,

David

Hi Simon,

 

Sorry I missed this earlier today somehow.

 

I have added an 8360 to represent colo BL into the LAB.

 

In summary, it seems to all work fine. I have had cross site pings between L3VNI and L2VNI clients whilst connected at Colo-BL, CC-DL and CL-DL. Also done some link failure testing and that was solid – interesting with the eBGP multihop setting that we are retaining BGP sessions between CC-BL and CL-BL when we drop the physically attached link between them as it just re-routes via Colo – if we intend to retain this aspect I can’t particularly think of a downside.

 

Our gremlin was Microsoft Windows firewall on clients allowing ICMP inbound from it’s subnet but not from outside, so as we thought, the EVPN was good and thankfully this was nothing to do with the 6300 ??

 

I do need to add your user in to the 8360s, I’ll get that sorted tomorrow, for now I have attached all the config (excluding INET switch which I haven’t got round to connecting to new BLs) and thrown in a diagram I was using to keep tabs on interfaces on new hardware.

 

Many thanks,

David

Good morning,

 

Happy new year to you all! 

 

Thanks for the update David. I do recall reading a section in the guide around the supported platform for the Border VTEP / Border Leader roles within a multi-fabric solution, snippet below:

 

Supported platform

The EVPN VXLAN multi-fabric solution is supported only with the 8325 and 10000* Switch Series as a

border-leader VTEP.

Border VTEPs (but non-border-leaders) that support this solution include the 8325, 8360, and 10000

Switch Series.

Non-border VTEPS that support this solution include the 6300, 6400, 8325, 8360, 8400, and 10000 Switch

Series.

For the 10000 Switch series, a firewall policy is not supported when the switch is acting as a border-VTEP or

border-leader.

 

As you can see in the notes above the 6300 is not listed as a supported platform for both the Border Leader and Border VTEP roles, however, as is quite often the case this does not mean that it will now work, more so that it has not been validated by HPE. Though it would seem in this case the functionality required at this layer in the fabric is not supported by the hardware... I would need HPE to confirm that 100% though....

 

In terms on the product selection for the end design we are good as we have positioned 8325's here.

 

If you could please send me the updated configs for the border VTEPs so i can review the changes to BGP and Route Targets that would be appreciated!

 

Many thanks,

Simon

Hi all,

 

Right today has been interesting.

 

I have used some 8360s to create CC to CL BL peerings in place of the 6300. This has allowed be to issue the evpn command for disabling split horizon for the vtep from iBGP to eBGP.

 

I have adjusted the RTs, such that iBGP uses auto derived for import/export and eBGP will use manually configured RT – this is working fine.

 

I have next-hop-self toward the iBGP environment for L2VPN routes learnt from eBGP peer.

 

We do now have the data plane VXLAN tunnels working cross site (apparently our design is still a single fabric but considered multi-site).

 

L2VNI all good

 

L3VNI sort of good, works between loopbacks and clients can reach the remote site – same issue as yesterday. I’m almost 100% that this is a 6300M routing issue and nothing to do with our EVPN constructs. I have taken a vanilla 6300M out of stock and created 2 SVIs and connected the clients to each. Only the direct VLAN SVI on the switch can ping a client in its VLAN (SVI 100 can ping access vlan 100 client, SVI 200 can ping access vlan 200 client) – but it is not possible for SVI 200 to ping access vlan 100 client (routed internally by the switch – this is crazy and must surely be the most basic problem to solve yet I’m giving up now – the documentation I have for 6300M devices on 10.13 does not match fully the config options I see. The clients could not ping each other on this vanilla out of the box switch.

 

So, in summary – I think we’re almost there – but we do need to introduce another 8360 (which we can do in New Year) to take place of the Colo BL – to make sure we’re controlling routes etc.

 

Have a great Christmas & New Year,

Simon,

 

We can both access the guide, we are in a better place after the changes, but we have one issue we haven’t worked out yet, was hoping to find it in the doc, or config.

 

We are trying to get a ping reply using the laptops in Vlan 100 from CC-DL TO CL-DL 10.100.2.10 to 10.100.4.10, but doesn’t work.

 

Strange thing is both laptops can hit the gateway 10.100.2.254 and 10.100.4.254 in the remote DL but not the Laptop.

pcap

 



 

I’m off tomorrow back in on the 3rd Jan, David is going to have a look tomorrow and he’s back in on 2nd Jan.

 

Happy xmas and happy new year

Hi all,

 

I have been skimming through the configuration guide for VXLAN-EVPN and Chapter 6 contains various examples of multi-fabric solutions which utilise a single ASN per-fabric, which is essentially what we are trying to do. The configuration guide can be accessed here:

 

https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/AOS-CX/10.14/PDF/vxlan.pdf <https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/AOS-CX/10.14/PDF/vxlan.pdf> 

 

Let me know if you can't access the guide and I will put it in Kiteworks as it is too large to attach.

 

I think with the recent changes that David has made we are not far off, however, I think some work around route-targets and route-maps will be required so that only the border VTEPs are in a full-mesh configuration instead of all VTEPs across the fabrics.

 

I am back in on the 2nd so if we can pick this up again then that would be great.

 

I hope you all have a good Xmas and New Year.

 

Regards,

Simon

Thanks David.

 

Please can you send me a capture of the latest configs so that I can see the changes you have made. I think you a right, we do not want a full-mesh between all leafs across fabrics, the tunnel should only be between the two borders. That is where i believe the command "dyn-vxlan-tunnel-bridging-mode ibgp-ebgp" should come in.

 

I will see if I can find anything else in the documentation, I will also send a summary of what has been setup, tested etc to the SE at HPE that I was working with, though I suspect I won't get a response now until after the Xmas break.

 

On the L3VNI side, I had the virtual-mac configured in the VSX setup at HPE but must have missed it when I was putting the scripts together so apologies for that! Are you able to now route between all of the locally-defined networks on the leafs vis the L3VNI?

 

Thanks,

Simon

L2 pings work on VLAN 300 below cross fabric



 

but this isn’t the right approach for cross-fabric VXLAN tunnels as we’ll end up with a mesh between leafs across fabrics – was speaking to Kev last week about the DCI connect approach between fabrics

I may have had an epiphany, if I have we can put it down to Sierra Nevada California IPA.

 

With cross fabric Layer 2 the config is currently set within EVPN to auto derive the route target. VLAN 200 is our focus.



 

 

What that means is this:



 

And because the other side of our fabric is a different BGP AS, also with auto derived Route Targets, then perhaps although the route is there, it is not really being imported  as the RT does not match for evpn on the other side (even though the MAC is in BGP).

 

So, given the cross campus didn’t work on VLAN 200, I have configured this:



 

We now have a manually defined RT of 300:300. Which gives:



 



On Monday we can try interface 1/1/6 of each DL over Layer 2.

 

Many thanks,

David

Afternoon all,

 

I have tried to make some progress with our lab environment today.

 

I’ve had some success with the L3VNI traffic, but ran out of time to look at L2VNI – I did a couple of tests with L2VNI with a client in 1/1/5 of CC-BL and CL-BL, no joy, but between CL-DL and CL-BL the L2VNI was successful.

 

For L3VNI I’ll try and recall what I’ve done before the weekend as I will forget!

 

[1] I’ve added a virtual-mac to the configurations

*	Without this L3VNI pings between CC-DL & CC-BL were not successful
*	I believe this relates to asymmetric IRB

 

[2] I’ve made the underlay visible throughout by redistributing the bgp IPv4 family used between border leafs into OSPF at each fabric

*	Seemed to be required as the BGP config is not next-hop self toward own AS devices and DLs had no path to the next hop on L2VPN EVPN RT 5, e.g. CL-BL loopback 0 was next hop but no path to it on CC-DL
*	As a fun gotcha, the interfaces that face the Borderleafs were added the ip ospf 1 area 0 command, so that OSPF would know about the underlay link which is used only for BGP

 

[3] I’ve added a BGP command to the L2VPN family at the BLs (eBGP) to prevent the default eBGP behaviour of modifying next hop – this was required for cross fabric ping for VRF campus

*	Next-hop-unchanged was added to L2VPN at BLs but not toward Spines

 

[4] I did redistribute local loopbacks for the DLs within the VRF campus, these interfaces I used for end to end tests

 



 

 

Many thanks

 

David

Good afternoon gents.

 

I have put together a Visio diagram and have produced initial configuration scripts for the EVPN test rig we discussed setting up on Friday last week, these are in the attached zip file.

 

For this build you will need a minimum of eight HPE Aruba 6300M 48G switches. I have nominated which interfaces should be used on the diagram as these relate to specific config in the scripts. I have built the scripts manually so apologies if there are any typos or incorrect syntax.

 

In each of the scripts there is a few lines of config for the out of band management port, you will need to assign an IP address to each switch and configure it with the associated gateway IP so that the rig can be accessed remotely.

 

This should at the very least give you a good starting point but if you have any questions or problems please give me a shout.

 

Thanks,

Hi David,

 

It was just 16x units, (2 boxes), however our contractor has come back after a survey and we need some more of these MP10-X adaptor brackets for another area bringing it up to a total of 31 units (4 boxes).

Stuart,

 

This was just a first pass at it, but of there is a particular structure you have in mind then let me know. Or if you would prefer it in a kind of story of the development of Vision?

 

I appreciate in is in a standard format and the headings don’t work for each release, but I will sort that.

 

Let me know if this is of any use to you.

Stuart,

 

This is a short summary of all the case studies in terms of innovation we have done for various higher education customers. I will save the case studies in the project folder.

I have also added a bit of information on “Discover, See, Engage” . . . which I appreciate is not something you have spent any time on but it really was just a way of formalising the process we developed over the years with the mind maps, vision etc.

No mate . . . you will get them, what I meant was I don’t know the quantity split yet so I didn’t want to add them to the quote just yet, but whether they are listed on the quote or not I can assure you, that you will get them and no additional cost. ??

Hi David

 

Im not sure I understand how training credits are provided ; I thought after the last email it was being divided up across the orders and they were an additional bonus to get engineers trained on Aruba equipment 

 

But reading below sounds like we pay for them with any order but maybe at a reduced rate, is this correct ?

 

Thanks

Dylan, Glen,

 

Regarding training credits, there isn’t a framework for getting training credits, it is generally calculated on the value of any given order. For example the big value quotes Mike has split 100 credits across all (I think there is 3) of those. 

 

Glen, you have emailed regarding the revised AP refresh quote, so when that order comes in you will get a proportion of those 100 credits. I hope that makes sense. ??

Dylan,

 

Just to check . . . you want 160 brackets? Or do you want 16? Just that the part number is a pack of 10, so just wanted to double check.

 

Thanks,

Jack,

 

We need some assistance with this one . . . Heidi is struggling to get this quote on the system as we apparently have to do a deal reg first? Obviously, we need this back quickly so is there anything that you can help with? Maybe you can get Andy to help also?

Subject:	RE: Quote Request -  HPE Aruba EdgeConnect SD-WAN router

Hi Karen,

 

I hope this email finds you well.

 

Thank you for your recent RFQ for the HPE Aruba EdgeConnect SD-WAN gateways and the 1G bandwidth license. To ensure we provide the correct configuration and licensing for your requirements, could you please clarify whether the two SD-WAN gateways will be deployed in a clustered (HA) configuration or as independent devices?

 

*	If you plan to deploy the gateways in an HA cluster, an additional High Availability (HA) license (JM091AAS) will be required to share the 1G bandwidth license across both appliances.
*	If the gateways will operate as independent devices, you will require two bandwidth licenses (JM084AAS)—one for each gateway.

 

This information will help us tailor the quotation to your needs and avoid any licensing issues during deployment. Please let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

 

Regards,

 

David Dunlop

Hi David,

 

I hope you are having a good break, and I do not expect a reply to this email until the new year

 

Has Andrew Johnson been in touch with you before the Christmas break reference the above, if not can you send the updated quote for CP licences for NAC (using the updated licence count)  it seems that this project is something that may happen next year.

 

Thanks again and I will be in touch in the new year.

 

Glen

Glen,

 

Yes, I can get that revised. 

 

Also, I'm speaking Kelly about your license count today so hopefully I'll be in a position to send the email regarding support, licenses etc. I also have a follow up with Mike today on all things Glen & Durham so hopefully have a better picture of the account and license issue too.

 

Thanks,

 

David

Morning

 

A few years back we embarked on a NAC project, but it was stopped for various internal reasons, I am being asked now to get an update licence quote from yourselves for ClearPass.

 

Do you have the old quote that you can refresh 

 

Thanks
