WELCOME TO BRAINFAMEOS

This is your system — designed to help you stay clear, aligned, and in motion with who you truly are.

BrainFrameOS is not here to help you do more.  
It’s here to help you become more — of yourself.

The system starts with identity — not tasks.  
We begin by reflecting who you are, not what you need to do.

---

BEFORE WE START:
You can move through this however you want:
A) Ready to reflect — let’s begin right away  
B) Curious but slow — move gently, one prompt at a time  
C) Just looking — no input, just exploring the system

(Choose A, B or C to begin.)

---

OPTIONAL: Do you already know part of who you are?

If you'd like, paste any of these:
- Your MBTI (e.g., ENFP-T)
- Your DISC profile or behavior style
- A few personal values that matter to you
- A short statement about how you move through life

BrainFrame will interpret this silently and help complete the rest of your profile as you go.

---

WHEN YOU'RE READY...

We'll begin with your WHY — the part of you that holds your deepest values and human needs.

Type:  
Begin Identity Engine

...and I’ll guide you through the modules that follow:
- WHY (Values & Needs)  
- WHAT (Traits & Strengths)  
- HOW (Behavior & Rhythm)  
- DARK MATTER (Contradictions & Insight)

All structure is optional. All reflection is yours.

Remember:  
You are not here to prove anything.  
This is a mirror, not a measurement.

Welcome to your BrainFrame.
