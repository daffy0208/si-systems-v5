Hey — this is a system I use called BrainFrameOS.  
It’s not an app — it’s more like a reflection system.  
You unzip the folder, open the START_HERE.txt, and paste it into ChatGPT.  
That’s it. No installs, no logins, no pressure.

It starts by helping you reconnect with who you are — not what you have to do.  
Just go slow. It’ll match your rhythm.  
Let me know if you want to reflect on anything together.
