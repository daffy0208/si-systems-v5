Simon / David,

 

When we met on the 18th we agreed a follow up w/c 31st March, to carry out a further review and potentially sign-off the HLD. Given the feedback this week, can you please advise when you will be ready to host the kick-off / design workshop , preparing a SoW and detailed delivery plan. 

 

With us having Ben available to us from 21st April I’m keen for us to progress.

Hi Ian, 

 

We held a meeting in February and we are aware of your May 31st deadline.

 

I spoke to Simon, he is working on your HLD which he hopes to complete by end of play Friday 14th March.  He will get that over to you for review shortly after.  

 

Simon is onsite with Northumbria University staff, for a meeting with HPE on the 18th March, if you could book out a room from about 12 for a working lunch, he will be able to run you through the HLD.  Please be aware he has a 6-hour drive home after that meeting so time will be a little restrictive.

 

Once the HLD is agreed, the next step is to have a kickoff meeting or design workshop with Ben Richards, from which he can create an LLD or SOW before commencing work.

 

We mentioned on the call, but you will not be aware, Qolcom have a large 4 week All hands engagement starting next week, involving all our engineers who will be out of the country, largely without internet access.

 

That said, you will see I have blocked Ben’s calendar out from 21 April through 31 May.  The work won’t take that long and I can refine his time down as we get closer, but it prevents him being assigned to other projects until we iron out our timeline.

 

Regards

 

Andrew Fowler

 

Project Manager

Hi Andrew,

 

Thank you for reaching out and as your probably aware I’m keen to getting moving on this given that we have a deadline of 31st May to complete. Can you schedule a kick-off for w/c 17th March, that is giving two weeks to enable Simon to complete the HLD/LLD.

 

Any queries or concerns, please don’t hesitate in contacting me.

 

Thanks & regards

Thanks Kevin.

 

Just as a note, I am currently updating the original HLD document which I produced for City Campus to reflect all of the changes that have either happened or been agreed since then. The document will take into consideration the work that has been completed to date, reference the testing carried out recently and provide a baseline  for us to take forward into the design workshop(s), the production of a revised LLD and then into the implementation and testing phases.

 

There is quite a bit of material that needs to be worked into this document plus changes to the original content so I am going to need a week or so to get it to a place I am comfortable with. 

 

As soon as it is ready I will review it with the team here and get it published to you.

 

Thanks,

Simon

Hi Shane,

 

Thanks for coming back to us. We're looking for a little support with the Infoblox software upgrade. After reading the notes it seems like a big jump forward, so maybe a day with them would be useful?

 

If you could speak to them and get us a cost that would be great.

 

Thanks,

Hi Mat,

 

Unfortunately from my records it looks as though all of the time was used up in the end. I can speak to David and arrange a scoping session if that would help so we could see what help was needed and what effort may be required?

 

Kind regards

Hi Shane, 

 

Do we have any remaining time with Exclusive networks from what we have purchased over the last couple of years? We're considering the upgrade of our Infoblox Grid and it looks like its a fairly large tasks that a little support might be helpful.

Good morning,

 

Great to see you all yesterday briefly!

 

Attaching my slides I ran through at the end, so you can have a read up on PCBE & VME.

 

The more imminent opportunity we have at hand, is to try and get some CloudPhysics assessments deployed out into your key and or/prospect customers. This is going to generate a comprehensive 14 page report you can utilize to open the doors for consolidation conversations. Storage and Compute refresh opportunity will just then come naturally.

 

If you want any help or have any further questions, just give me a call.

 

Kind regards,

Good morning,

 

Great to see you all yesterday briefly!

 

Attaching my slides I ran through at the end, so you can have a read up on PCBE & VME.

 

The more imminent opportunity we have at hand, is to try and get some CloudPhysics assessments deployed out into your key and or/prospect customers. This is going to generate a comprehensive 14 page report you can utilize to open the doors for consolidation conversations. Storage and Compute refresh opportunity will just then come naturally.

 

If you want any help or have any further questions, just give me a call.

 

Kind regards,

Hi David, 

 

Sorry for the delay, in replying. 

 

I have checked & we believe this is already setup for cross-tenant access. @Ian Jackson <mailto:ian.jackson@northumbria.ac.uk>  had it enabled for some of other projects. 

 

Is it something we can test ? Must admit not sure how to do that ? 

 

Thanks,

Kevin

Kevin,

 

Further to our conversation about setting up MS Teams for collaboration in all our projects, I have spoken to our IT Manager, Ben Hay who is looking to get this set up for us. 

 

With the work we’re doing across EVPN multi-fabric, automation, and long-term network strategy, we see Cross-Tenant Access as a way to simplify engagement and collaboration between our teams, this will help immensely with sharing resources and working across Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft 365 services. To support this, we have now configured Cross-Tenant Access on our side within Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) and wanted to check whether Northumbria University would be able to implement the required setup at your end as well. Enabling this would allow users from both organisations to collaborate more efficiently without requiring guest accounts, ensuring a smoother, more integrated experience. 

 

Would you be able to check internally whether this can be enabled at your side? If needed, we’re happy to share further details or coordinate with your IT team to facilitate the setup.

Let me know your thoughts.

Regards,

 

 

David Dunlop

Hi David,

 

Just a kind reminder that Durham University has expiring contract 2137991312 (Controllers, Mobility Conductor, ClearPass) by end of this month! We had issued attach quotes that were shared with you by Westcoast. You mentioned that you were reviewing client infrastructure and will be co-terming more contracts where support is needed. Would you share what is current status on this?

 

Thank you in advance and looking forward for you reply.

 

Best regards,

Hi Eliska,

 

Apologies for not replying sooner but thank you for following up and for providing the renewal quotes. We really appreciate the effort in getting these options over to us.

 

I just wanted to clarify that while these quotes are certainly useful, they represent only a small part of Durham University's overall support renewal. While they might seem like straightforward renewal options, the situation is more complex, as their full renewal involves multiple elements that need to be considered together. We have a structured process for support renewals, ensuring that everything is reviewed as a whole and co-termed where appropriate. This helps maintain consistency, simplifies ongoing management for the customer, and ensures the best overall outcome. That process is already in place, and we are currently working on finalising the full support renewal quote for Durham University.

 

Their renewal date remains April 1st, so we are actively working towards providing them with a comprehensive and aligned proposal.

 

I will let you know how we get on.

 

Best regards,
 

David Dunlop

I'll let you know as soon as I have anything.

 

Thanks,

Stel,

 

I really need to get back to the customer with something positive. Any chance you can get this sorted soon, as the customer is getting pretty desperate.

 

Much appreciated,

Stel,

 

I have the quote for the Keele University Aps now. Can you help me understand what they can get for swapping out 12 x AP-585 aps?

Based on Mat Bailey’s request, Keele University is looking to achieve the following:

 

Objectives:

1.	Swap Access Points

	*	Exchange 12x AP-585 units for AP-587 models.
	*	Ensure the best possible swap ratio (likely considering value or stock availability).
	*	All AP-585 units are unused and still boxed, which may facilitate the swap.

 

Thanks,

 

 

David Dunlop

Hi All

Please can I ask you to look at your open orders in Dynamics and advise on any customers who may be prepared to take a part shipment on their order.  I will then cross reference with the back-order report and release any goods currently in stock at distribution.

Please come back to me by midday tomorrow.  

If I don’t hear from you I will move all your orders, currently with an estimated completion date of end March, out to April.

Thanks, Heidi

Hello gents,

 

We need to renew all bar 1 of our sales certs this year.  Minimum of 5, up to possibly 7 will be required.  Would it be possible to do an afternoon on site and can you support with exam vouchers?

Thanks

 

Ben

Hi David, 

I've received a message from our procurement team, there's an issue with In-tend, and they are raising a ticket. Please see below:

Dear Bidder,
 
Thank you for your interest in the recently issued RFI exercise, the University had significant interest in this exercise. After careful consideration, we regret to inform you that we will not be inviting your company to participate in a subsequent RFP exercise for Network Equipment and Services. I would like to thank you for your interest in the contract, the University recognises, and appreciates, the time and effort taken by suppliers in responding to University of Manchester opportunities and hope that your lack of success in this instance will not deter you from expressing an interest in any future opportunities
 
Kind Regards
Central Procurement Office

Kind regards

Hi Ben,

 

I've been passed your name as somebody to talk to around the monitoring and management for some networking equipment.

 

I'm working on some indicative pricing for a customer with several distilleries throughout Scotland. 

 

In total there are-

 

Switches: 66

WAPs: 221

 

All Aruba however customer has not provided models

 

There are also 2 Sophos UTM Firewalls, on all sites- with the exception of one of the small distilleries that has just 1 

 

Eric Lindsey suggested that I run the opportunity through you guys to see if there would be an appetite for it?

Hey, 

 

It’s an initial yes from Qolcom, but would need a call to discuss further. I don’t know how far down the line you’ve got with the customer etc. 

 

But if we’re still in a suitable position to engage Qolcom with the customer, can you advise some suitable dates for a call please

Customer has just replied with the following: 

 

The main part for me is having a network architect to help design how we should segment our network and recommend what equipment we should use to achieve this  (Using equipment we already have or buying new equipment)

 

This is the scope, beyond the initial Site Survey to understand what they have ??

Subject: FW: John G Russell- Networking Audit 

 

Hi Countdown,

 

Ticket: #SR-21094

 

We’ve had a bit of back and forth with Technimove on this opportunity, but I was wondering if Qolcom could support?

 

The original ask: 

 

We are looking to see if we could get a Network Architect consultant, we have a big network security project and we are requiring someone with network expertise to advise / help plan this project. The main things we need advice/expertise on is, • Network segmentation • Methodology • Technology

 

Scotty then followed up with a call with the customer and qualified the following: 

 

20 sites, however 3 main sites is where we need to focus the work. All in Glasgow.

Meraki SD-WAN

Mix of Aruba and Cisco new and old switching.

Flat network. Looking to re-architect and segment

Would like an audit and proposal on what steps to take to make the network more secure.

Look to send and engineer or an on-site audit but also provide a price for a report based on inventory and network diagrams they provide.

 

John G Russell Transport Ltd are keen to get moving on this, so Qolcom capabilities to cover this work and availability would great to know before we proceed with Technimove.  

 

@Topping, Bethan <mailto:bethan.topping@bechtle.com> , just to confirm, would all the work be required in Glasgow?

 

Thanks in advance,

HI Bethan

 

Of course totally understand 

 

The day rate would be the same as the previous quote as will be the same L6 consultant – as mentioned we are suggesting 2 – 3 days per site ( so 6-9 days plus the PM 2 days ) this gives an idea but until we understand how the networks are currently set up and how far the client wants the segregation to go I can’t commit 

 

Current audit quote is at 2 days per site – 6 days and 2 days PM

So you can’t produce an indicative cost for Network design? Not even a day rate? 

 

In future please can you include me in the communications as I wouldn’t have known on the below until I chased it. My customer is chasing me for updates and doesn’t look great. 

 

Sure if you don’t mind. Id appreciate a quick update here as we’ve been working on this for almost a month.

HI Bethan 

 

I was just typing to you – I spoke with Scotty yesterday post email 

 

We unfortunately cannot give you a definite quote for this as until we have been to site and completely the audit and understand how the client will wont their networks segregated – what they are looking to achieve at each site. However at this stage we can say if you replicate the existing quote ie 2 – 3 days per site ( so 6-9 days plus the PM 2 days ) this gives an idea but sorry until we understand how the networks are currently set up and how far the client wants the segregation to go I can’t commit 

 

In regard to the Audit do you want me to look at dates for availability?

Hi Megan,

 

If you could give Bethan a price on doing the design work after the Audit that would be great. Makes sense if it can all be done as one piece of work.

Hi Bethan  

 

If Bechtle want us to assist then yes of course

	Hi Simon,

	 

	Thanks for sending the sites across,

	 

	Please could you advise on how much kit it will be per site,

	 

	Understandably we are completing the physical audit to fully comprehend the kit onsite, however we would need a steer on rough quantities so we can scope how long is needed for each site.

	 

	Regarding the logical audit, @Coombs, Scott <mailto:scott.coombs@bechtle.com>  do you know what you want in scope? Or can we jump on a call to scope with our presales team.

	 

	Best regards,

	Subject: RE: John G Russell- Networking Audit 

	 

	Hi Simon,

	 

	Just a few comments from our presales team, could you advise me on the below?

	 

	Is it just a device audit? Or would this require cabling tracing also.

	 

	We also need to know how many racks/devices are in scope so we can price (1 rack worth of it? 2 racks etc) – would you be able to share photos?

	 

	We would also need the other site locations.

	 

	Could you please send this information asap and I can then get ball rolling on my end.

	 

	Best regards,

	Mo

	Hi Mo,

	 

	As discussed, Scott is in the process of putting together a network refresh for John G Russel, the network is currently flat with a small number of devices across 3 sites in Scotland.

	 

	Would it be possible to provide pricing for an engineer to attend the sites and carry out an audit of the equipment on site. 

	 

	It is currently believed that the audit shouldn't take more than 1 day to complete

	 

	The primary site address is-

	 

	John G Russell

	Deanside Road

	Glasgow

	G52 4XB 

	 

	I'm awaiting confirmation of the other site addresses

Hi Ben,

I've been passed your name as somebody to talk to around the monitoring and management for some networking equipment.

I'm working on some indicative pricing for a customer with several distilleries throughout Scotland. 

In total there are-


Switches: 66

WAPs: 221


All Aruba however customer has not provided models

There are also 2 Sophos UTM Firewalls, on all sites- with the exception of one of the small distilleries that has just 1 

Eric Lindsey suggested that I run the opportunity through you guys to see if there would be an appetite for it?

Please raise each one as an opp with a quote under Bechtle (with the end user detailed)

Use part number QOL-BEC-MARGIN-SHARE with the agreed value (as the sell price) and zero cost

Make sure you change the owner of the opp and quote to the relevant sales person – shout if you’re having problems with that bit

We can then invoice out from the quote/sales order and figures will be allocated accordingly to the correct person’s goals

Morning Gents,

 

Is it worth having a section on CRM that will allow us to include estimated margin share that we will receive from Bechtle, as I assume that it will count towards target?

 

We’ve already had one Cisco deal from Bentley land (60/40 split) and are about to close a decent size Citrix project (55 days P.S. plus Citrix kit) with them too (50/50 split), so would be helpful for us to keep tabs at a high level.

Hello David,

 

Sorry for delay in responding to this RFQ, these were due to some clarifications that were needed.

 

Thank you for your interest in this RFQ opportunity. 

 

I am pleased to inform you that yours was the most economically advantageous bid and we are able to proceed with your proposal, and will now arrange for the appropriate purchase order(s) to be issued.

Jennifer,

Thank you for inviting us to submit our quotation for Cumberland Council’s Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal.

Please find attached the following documents:

1.	Cisco Equipment EOL Status & Recommendations
2.	Itemized Pricing Breakdown for Cisco Support Renewal

Support Term:

*	Confirming support coverage from 01/04/2025 to 31/03/2026.

Clarifications as Requested:

*	EOL Component Coverage: 

	*	Cisco generally does not guarantee like-for-like replacements for components in equipment marked as End-of-Life. Availability for replacements is limited or not guaranteed. Proactive replacement planning is recommended.

Definitions:

*	End-of-Life (EOL) Equipment:
	Equipment no longer actively supported or sold by Cisco; no software updates, security patches, or guaranteed hardware replacements after the stated End-of-Support date.
*	Breakfix Services:
	Support services providing reactive maintenance, including hardware replacements or repairs, based on your chosen Service Level Agreement (Premium – 24x7x4 or Enhanced – 8x5xNBD).
*	CCO Account Association:
	Cumberland Council’s Cisco Customer Connection Online (CCO) account will be associated with this renewal, ensuring continued software access and updates.

Recommendations & Additional Considerations:

*	Consider immediate replacement of EOL equipment (Catalyst 3850 switches, UCS B200 M4 blades, and UCS chassis).
*	Evaluate multi-year support agreements for sustained cost savings.
*	Qolcom is available to support Cumberland Council in planning a phased, strategic approach for hardware replacements and infrastructure upgrades.

Please let me know if you require further clarification or details.

Regards,

 

David Dunlop

Subject: RE: Bechtle/Qolcom Margin share

 

Please raise each one as an opp with a quote under Bechtle (with the end user detailed)

Use part number QOL-BEC-MARGIN-SHARE with the agreed value (as the sell price) and zero cost

Make sure you change the owner of the opp and quote to the relevant sales person – shout if you’re having problems with that bit

We can then invoice out from the quote/sales order and figures will be allocated accordingly to the correct person’s goals

Subject: Bechtle/Qolcom Margin share

 

Morning Gents,

 

Is it worth having a section on CRM that will allow us to include estimated margin share that we will receive from Bechtle, as I assume that it will count towards target?

 

We’ve already had one Cisco deal from Bentley land (60/40 split) and are about to close a decent size Citrix project (55 days P.S. plus Citrix kit) with them too (50/50 split), so would be helpful for us to keep tabs at a high level.

 

Kind Regards,

Hi Andrew,

 

The meeting were good thanks. We went through the HLD, several items were confirmed and some changes agreed. I am now working through the document to make the changes and get the additional content in place. I told Ian Jackson that we will aim to have the document to them by next Friday (28th).

 

As soon as it is ready I will send it over to you.

 

Thanks,

Simon

H Andrew,

 

There is a HLD for the overall fabric solution which we have proposed, though no specific proposal has been created for the professional services piece.

 

Let’s schedule a call for next week when I am back in the UK to go over the requirements.

 

Thanks,

Simon

H Andrew,

 

There is a HLD for the overall fabric solution which we have proposed, though no specific proposal has been created for the professional services piece.

 

Let’s schedule a call for next week when I am back in the UK to go over the requirements.

 

Thanks,

Simon

Hi David,

 

Can you advise on the information below please so we can make a decision?

 

We have had a look at the quote (attached) and there is an issue with the spreadsheet in that some of the device descriptions in columns C and F don’t match and this affects the support level. Eg  see below

 



 

The C1113 router isa branch router but on the same line and you have costed this against a data centre access switch on Premium support (24x7) but we’d only need 8x5 as we’d asked for on the C1113. We think you have just got some of the columns mismatching. There’s a few others too in the list with mismatches the same. Can you rectify and resend to us so that device names match in columns C and F and then it’s clear what the support level is for the device? Thank you.

 

Kind Regards, Jennifer

Jennifer,

Thank you for inviting us to submit our quotation for Cumberland Council’s Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal.

Please find attached the following documents:

1.	Cisco Equipment EOL Status & Recommendations
2.	Itemized Pricing Breakdown for Cisco Support Renewal

Support Term:

*	Confirming support coverage from 01/04/2025 to 31/03/2026.

Clarifications as Requested:

*	EOL Component Coverage: 

	*	Cisco generally does not guarantee like-for-like replacements for components in equipment marked as End-of-Life. Availability for replacements is limited or not guaranteed. Proactive replacement planning is recommended.

Definitions:

*	End-of-Life (EOL) Equipment:
	Equipment no longer actively supported or sold by Cisco; no software updates, security patches, or guaranteed hardware replacements after the stated End-of-Support date.
*	Breakfix Services:
	Support services providing reactive maintenance, including hardware replacements or repairs, based on your chosen Service Level Agreement (Premium – 24x7x4 or Enhanced – 8x5xNBD).
*	CCO Account Association:
	Cumberland Council’s Cisco Customer Connection Online (CCO) account will be associated with this renewal, ensuring continued software access and updates.

Recommendations & Additional Considerations:

*	Consider immediate replacement of EOL equipment (Catalyst 3850 switches, UCS B200 M4 blades, and UCS chassis).
*	Evaluate multi-year support agreements for sustained cost savings.
*	Qolcom is available to support Cumberland Council in planning a phased, strategic approach for hardware replacements and infrastructure upgrades.

Please let me know if you require further clarification or details.

Regards,

 

David Dunlop

Hi Nick

 

It is not all 6200F it’s just the RevA SKUs, see official announcement attached.

In terms of the latest Lead time please find attached details (please do not share externally the file).

 

Do let us know in case of any questions

Subject: Aruba 6200F Switch - Is it Going End of Sale?

 

Hi Nik

 

I have heard from a couple of sources that the CX 6200F Range is going end of sale fairly shortly? Can you confirm this is the case or not?

 

If it is the case please can you let me know what is replacing it in the Aruba range. I have a good many customers that have this switch range and need to understand what I position moving forward. I can’t just tell them it’s going end of sale (if it is) with no replacement.

 

Can you also provide a leadtime’s update on Aruba Switches, APs and Optics. I am hearing that some APs and Switches are on extended leadtimes and some Optics are up to 20 weeks.

 

Thanks

 

Nick

Hi David,

 

Can you advise on the information below please so we can make a decision?

 

We have had a look at the quote (attached) and there is an issue with the spreadsheet in that some of the device descriptions in columns C and F don’t match and this affects the support level. Eg  see below

 



 

The C1113 router isa branch router but on the same line and you have costed this against a data centre access switch on Premium support (24x7) but we’d only need 8x5 as we’d asked for on the C1113. We think you have just got some of the columns mismatching. There’s a few others too in the list with mismatches the same. Can you rectify and resend to us so that device names match in columns C and F and then it’s clear what the support level is for the device? Thank you.

 

Kind Regards, Jennifer

Subject: RE: Request for Quote - Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal (** REVISED LIST **)

 

Jennifer,

Thank you for inviting us to submit our quotation for Cumberland Council’s Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal.

Please find attached the following documents:

1.	Cisco Equipment EOL Status & Recommendations
2.	Itemized Pricing Breakdown for Cisco Support Renewal

Support Term:

*	Confirming support coverage from 01/04/2025 to 31/03/2026.

Clarifications as Requested:

*	EOL Component Coverage: 

	*	Cisco generally does not guarantee like-for-like replacements for components in equipment marked as End-of-Life. Availability for replacements is limited or not guaranteed. Proactive replacement planning is recommended.

Definitions:

*	End-of-Life (EOL) Equipment:
	Equipment no longer actively supported or sold by Cisco; no software updates, security patches, or guaranteed hardware replacements after the stated End-of-Support date.
*	Breakfix Services:
	Support services providing reactive maintenance, including hardware replacements or repairs, based on your chosen Service Level Agreement (Premium – 24x7x4 or Enhanced – 8x5xNBD).
*	CCO Account Association:
	Cumberland Council’s Cisco Customer Connection Online (CCO) account will be associated with this renewal, ensuring continued software access and updates.

Recommendations & Additional Considerations:

*	Consider immediate replacement of EOL equipment (Catalyst 3850 switches, UCS B200 M4 blades, and UCS chassis).
*	Evaluate multi-year support agreements for sustained cost savings.
*	Qolcom is available to support Cumberland Council in planning a phased, strategic approach for hardware replacements and infrastructure upgrades.

Please let me know if you require further clarification or details.

Regards,

 

David Dunlop

There’s something still not right with the list – unless it’s how it’s rendering on my laptop. Can we perhaps jump on a quick call so I can show you what I mean?

Hi David,

 

Can you advise on the information below please so we can make a decision?

 

We have had a look at the quote (attached) and there is an issue with the spreadsheet in that some of the device descriptions in columns C and F don’t match and this affects the support level. Eg  see below

 



 

The C1113 router isa branch router but on the same line and you have costed this against a data centre access switch on Premium support (24x7) but we’d only need 8x5 as we’d asked for on the C1113. We think you have just got some of the columns mismatching. There’s a few others too in the list with mismatches the same. Can you rectify and resend to us so that device names match in columns C and F and then it’s clear what the support level is for the device? Thank you.

 

Kind Regards, Jennifer

Subject: RE: Request for Quote - Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal (** REVISED LIST **)

 

Jennifer,

Thank you for inviting us to submit our quotation for Cumberland Council’s Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal.

Please find attached the following documents:

1.	Cisco Equipment EOL Status & Recommendations
2.	Itemized Pricing Breakdown for Cisco Support Renewal

Support Term:

*	Confirming support coverage from 01/04/2025 to 31/03/2026.

Clarifications as Requested:

*	EOL Component Coverage: 

	*	Cisco generally does not guarantee like-for-like replacements for components in equipment marked as End-of-Life. Availability for replacements is limited or not guaranteed. Proactive replacement planning is recommended.

Definitions:

*	End-of-Life (EOL) Equipment:
	Equipment no longer actively supported or sold by Cisco; no software updates, security patches, or guaranteed hardware replacements after the stated End-of-Support date.
*	Breakfix Services:
	Support services providing reactive maintenance, including hardware replacements or repairs, based on your chosen Service Level Agreement (Premium – 24x7x4 or Enhanced – 8x5xNBD).
*	CCO Account Association:
	Cumberland Council’s Cisco Customer Connection Online (CCO) account will be associated with this renewal, ensuring continued software access and updates.

Recommendations & Additional Considerations:

*	Consider immediate replacement of EOL equipment (Catalyst 3850 switches, UCS B200 M4 blades, and UCS chassis).
*	Evaluate multi-year support agreements for sustained cost savings.
*	Qolcom is available to support Cumberland Council in planning a phased, strategic approach for hardware replacements and infrastructure upgrades.

Please let me know if you require further clarification or details.

Regards,

 

David Dunlop

My mistake, the p.o. we received was for a pre-install survey and not a post install survey. We will need to get an p.o. organised for this , , , I will get a quote sent over shortly.

 

Thanks,

 

 

David Dunlop

Hi,

 

I believe that Aveda ordered the above but to date Qolcom have not received a request for this work to go ahead, as all the WAP’s have now been installed we need to get this commissioned, as you are aware the move in date is fast approaching so it really needs doing ASAP

 

Cheers

Unfortunately, I need to head out early tonight to take the wee fella to football training, but I'm available all day tomorrow.

 

We've reviewed everything, although there are a few things we need to establish from the University, but I can go through that tomorrow.

 

Apologies for not being in touch sooner, just been very busy, but we'll get you sorted.

 

Thanks,

Tim,

 

 

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) not available yet

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) not available yet

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) not available yet

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors all plans reissued

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan roof plans of existing block attached

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) no basement, see attached cross section. I have also reissued the plans including the roof plan

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

We've reviewed everything, although there are a few things we need to establish from the University, but I can go through that tomorrow.

 

Apologies for not being in touch sooner, just been very busy, but we'll get you sorted.

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) not available yet

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) not available yet

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) not available yet

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors all plans reissued

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan roof plans of existing block attached

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) no basement, see attached cross section. I have also reissued the plans including the roof plan

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

Hi David, 

 

Yes, no problem, let me ask the question. I will start with security !

Kevin,

 

Further to our conversation about setting up MS Teams for collaboration in all our projects, I have spoken to our IT Manager, Ben Hay who is looking to get this set up for us. 

 

With the work we’re doing across EVPN multi-fabric, automation, and long-term network strategy, we see Cross-Tenant Access as a way to simplify engagement and collaboration between our teams, this will help immensely with sharing resources and working across Microsoft Teams and other Microsoft 365 services. To support this, we have now configured Cross-Tenant Access on our side within Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) and wanted to check whether Northumbria University would be able to implement the required setup at your end as well. Enabling this would allow users from both organisations to collaborate more efficiently without requiring guest accounts, ensuring a smoother, more integrated experience. 

 

Would you be able to check internally whether this can be enabled at your side? If needed, we’re happy to share further details or coordinate with your IT team to facilitate the setup.

Let me know your thoughts.

Regards,

 

 

David Dunlop

Hi Alex, David, Joe, Simon, Graham

 

Just wanted to say a big thanks for presentations over the last couple of days , we all found it very useful. I hope everyone was able to catch the train in time.

 

It certainly gives us some design considerations for the current design and for an idea on the steps required for features such as micro segmentation in the future. Useful to hear that we have a roadmap to that with the current design.

 

Any slides & presentations that can be shared will be useful for the team & heads up on any new material from yourself @Neville, Joe <mailto:joe.neville@hpe.com>  especially around troubleshooting would be great help.

 

I will catchup with @David Dunlop <mailto:ddunlop@qolcom.co.uk>  to discuss getting a Central setup to test on a few of 6300M switches , to start exploring the features.

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Hi Alex, David, Joe, Simon, Graham 

 

Just wanted to say a big thanks for presentations over the last couple of days , we all found it very useful. I hope everyone was able to catch the train in time. 

 

It certainly gives us some design considerations for the current design and for an idea on the steps required for features such as micro segmentation in the future. Useful to hear that we have a roadmap to that with the current design. 

 

Any slides & presentations that can be shared will be useful for the team & heads up on any new material from yourself @Neville, Joe <mailto:joe.neville@hpe.com>  especially around troubleshooting would be great help. 

 

I will catchup with @David Dunlop <mailto:ddunlop@qolcom.co.uk>  to discuss getting a Central setup to test on a few of 6300M switches , to start exploring the features.

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Hi guys,

Is it possible to share some of the slides from Mondays' session at Northumbria around the upcoming improvements/further plans coming along we can expect?  It was a great session - I'm also aware many of the slides were 'confidential' - I'm keen to pass on to the SMT/EU what is in the pipeline for the network improvements we are looking at to get an early buy is as soon as possible.  We've got some big plans with the Tech strategy and how it fits with the University strategy - improving the offering around research and sustainability and how we're working closely with our partners.

Whatever you can send over, would be great.

Take it easy,

Hi Andy,

 

Any joy with this I'm getting a bit of flack from the customer. Anything you can do is much appreciated.

 

Just a thought ... is there anything we can do with eval licenses in the meantime? If so would this cause any issues when the licenses finally arrive?

 

Thanks,

Hi,

 

How’s it going at Northumbria?

 

According to Neil Matcham Alex Goffe from Manchester and Somebody from Durham (not James) are being hosted on the Juniper table tonight. We didn’t even know there were tables that we could host people on!!!

 

Neil Matcham says they are doing a full building POC with Manchester. 

 

I’ll let you tell Mike Sharwin ??

Morning All,

 

A full schedule of Bechtle events can be found here - Events <https://www.bechtle.com/gb/about-bechtle/events> 

 

There is a registration form at the bottom of the events page to pre-register interest in the upcoming events, if there isn’t an official registration form available. So for example, you can pre-register interest for the golf day or tech summit as the marketing for those isn’t available yet, but the registration page for the webinar, Enhancing Cyber Security: Expert Tips and Techniques is already available and linked within the calendar - Microsoft Virtual Events Powered by Teams <https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/c33713cf-574b-4477-81ce-071fc70f3767@ecd106db-905e-428b-a596-a35a36d07bb0> .

 

If a customer wants to pre-register their interest in any of the events, then don’t forget to ask them to put your name in the “Who is your Account Manager” box – alternatively, you can fill it in on their behalf if preferred. Once pre-registered, we will have a list of all the customers who have pre-registered for each event, so will email them with a copy of the official invite once it’s available. By pre-registering their interest in an event, we will reserve them a space and once they’ve received the official invite (Qolcom branded), they’ll be given a date to confirm their place by.

 

 Any questions please shout or contact Beth Tomlins – cc’d (Bechtle Marketing)

 

Cheers…Keith

Hi David,

 

This is Durham’s Aruba renewal. I have priced the Central licenses the same as last year but the PBS is slightly cheaper this year.

 

The Central doesn’t expire until July but the PBS expires at the end of this month. I’m not sure how you quoted to the customer last year and if the price needs to match or not…

 

Let me know ??

 

Thanks,

Hope all is well on your side.

 

Have you manage to review the client’s infrastructure and have all necessary information for a renewal to be prepared? Just writing to align on the upcoming renewal that is due April 1st 2025!

 

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

 

Kind regards,

Hi David,

 

Thank you for this information.

 

Good to know that you are reviewing client infrastructure and ensuring that everything is covered with support where needed as well as co-terming contracts where appropriate. Please keep us informed on the offer preparation and let us know when it would be sent to pricing from Aruba side, so we can turn them over back to you asap.

 

If there is anything more we can help with, please let us know.

 

Best regards,

Subject: RE: Durham University, Aruba Support Renewal

 

Hi Eliska,

 

Apologies for not replying sooner but thank you for following up and for providing the renewal quotes. We really appreciate the effort in getting these options over to us.

 

I just wanted to clarify that while these quotes are certainly useful, they represent only a small part of Durham University's overall support renewal. While they might seem like straightforward renewal options, the situation is more complex, as their full renewal involves multiple elements that need to be considered together. We have a structured process for support renewals, ensuring that everything is reviewed as a whole and co-termed where appropriate. This helps maintain consistency, simplifies ongoing management for the customer, and ensures the best overall outcome. That process is already in place, and we are currently working on finalising the full support renewal quote for Durham University.

 

Their renewal date remains April 1st, so we are actively working towards providing them with a comprehensive and aligned proposal.

 

I will let you know how we get on.

 

Best regards,
 

David Dunlop

I'm afraid I haven't received anything regarding this yet, however I have passed the email along to our customer service team to see if they have received anything from westcoast yet.

 

I'll let you know as soon as I have anything.

Hi David,

 

Can you advise on the information below please so we can make a decision?

 

We have had a look at the quote (attached) and there is an issue with the spreadsheet in that some of the device descriptions in columns C and F don’t match and this affects the support level. Eg  see below

 



 

The C1113 router isa branch router but on the same line and you have costed this against a data centre access switch on Premium support (24x7) but we’d only need 8x5 as we’d asked for on the C1113. We think you have just got some of the columns mismatching. There’s a few others too in the list with mismatches the same. Can you rectify and resend to us so that device names match in columns C and F and then it’s clear what the support level is for the device? Thank you.

 

Kind Regards, Jennifer

Jennifer,

Thank you for inviting us to submit our quotation for Cumberland Council’s Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal.

Please find attached the following documents:

1.	Cisco Equipment EOL Status & Recommendations
2.	Itemized Pricing Breakdown for Cisco Support Renewal

Support Term:

*	Confirming support coverage from 01/04/2025 to 31/03/2026.

Clarifications as Requested:

*	EOL Component Coverage: 

	*	Cisco generally does not guarantee like-for-like replacements for components in equipment marked as End-of-Life. Availability for replacements is limited or not guaranteed. Proactive replacement planning is recommended.

Definitions:

*	End-of-Life (EOL) Equipment:
	Equipment no longer actively supported or sold by Cisco; no software updates, security patches, or guaranteed hardware replacements after the stated End-of-Support date.
*	Breakfix Services:
	Support services providing reactive maintenance, including hardware replacements or repairs, based on your chosen Service Level Agreement (Premium – 24x7x4 or Enhanced – 8x5xNBD).
*	CCO Account Association:
	Cumberland Council’s Cisco Customer Connection Online (CCO) account will be associated with this renewal, ensuring continued software access and updates.

Recommendations & Additional Considerations:

*	Consider immediate replacement of EOL equipment (Catalyst 3850 switches, UCS B200 M4 blades, and UCS chassis).
*	Evaluate multi-year support agreements for sustained cost savings.
*	Qolcom is available to support Cumberland Council in planning a phased, strategic approach for hardware replacements and infrastructure upgrades.

Please let me know if you require further clarification or details.

Regards,

 

David Dunlop

Hi David, 

 

Thanks for clarification.

 

I have attached a quote for the Ekahau Suite for you.

 

Depending on what they are trying to achieve they could need AI Pro and Connect as well as the Sidekick, but it’s not clear from Colin’s reply.

 

Happy to jump on a call if support is needed.

Michael,

 

Thanks for getting back to me and nice to meet you too. ??

 

Yes, this is in addition to their renewal from January. Below is what Colin sent to me . . .

 

“Hi David, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible. We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.”

 

I have replied to Colin with the options, so hopefully that all makes sense.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

I have picked this up from Craig as I look after Qolcom at Open Relaity. Nice to e-meet you.

 

Happy to help with a quote, I just need to check is this for an additional license for University of Aberdeen or renewal of existing license?

 

They renewed their existing license in January this year (PO-14662).

Hi David,

 

Can you advise on the information below please so we can make a decision?

 

We have had a look at the quote (attached) and there is an issue with the spreadsheet in that some of the device descriptions in columns C and F don’t match and this affects the support level. Eg  see below

 



 

The C1113 router isa branch router but on the same line and you have costed this against a data centre access switch on Premium support (24x7) but we’d only need 8x5 as we’d asked for on the C1113. We think you have just got some of the columns mismatching. There’s a few others too in the list with mismatches the same. Can you rectify and resend to us so that device names match in columns C and F and then it’s clear what the support level is for the device? Thank you.

 

Kind Regards, Jennifer

Subject: RE: Request for Quote - Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal (** REVISED LIST **)

 

Jennifer,

Thank you for inviting us to submit our quotation for Cumberland Council’s Cisco Premier Partner Support Renewal.

Please find attached the following documents:

1.	Cisco Equipment EOL Status & Recommendations
2.	Itemized Pricing Breakdown for Cisco Support Renewal

Support Term:

*	Confirming support coverage from 01/04/2025 to 31/03/2026.

Clarifications as Requested:

*	EOL Component Coverage: 

	*	Cisco generally does not guarantee like-for-like replacements for components in equipment marked as End-of-Life. Availability for replacements is limited or not guaranteed. Proactive replacement planning is recommended.

Definitions:

*	End-of-Life (EOL) Equipment:
	Equipment no longer actively supported or sold by Cisco; no software updates, security patches, or guaranteed hardware replacements after the stated End-of-Support date.
*	Breakfix Services:
	Support services providing reactive maintenance, including hardware replacements or repairs, based on your chosen Service Level Agreement (Premium – 24x7x4 or Enhanced – 8x5xNBD).
*	CCO Account Association:
	Cumberland Council’s Cisco Customer Connection Online (CCO) account will be associated with this renewal, ensuring continued software access and updates.

Recommendations & Additional Considerations:

*	Consider immediate replacement of EOL equipment (Catalyst 3850 switches, UCS B200 M4 blades, and UCS chassis).
*	Evaluate multi-year support agreements for sustained cost savings.
*	Qolcom is available to support Cumberland Council in planning a phased, strategic approach for hardware replacements and infrastructure upgrades.

Please let me know if you require further clarification or details.

Regards,

 

David Dunlop

Hi David, 

 

Thanks for clarification.

 

I have attached a quote for the Ekahau Suite for you.

 

Depending on what they are trying to achieve they could need AI Pro and Connect as well as the Sidekick, but it’s not clear from Colin’s reply.

 

Happy to jump on a call if support is needed.

Michael,

 

Thanks for getting back to me and nice to meet you too. ??

 

Yes, this is in addition to their renewal from January. Below is what Colin sent to me . . .

 

“Hi David, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible. We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.”

 

I have replied to Colin with the options, so hopefully that all makes sense.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

Hi David, 

 

I hope you are well. 

 

I have picked this up from Craig as I look after Qolcom at Open Relaity. Nice to e-meet you.

 

Happy to help with a quote, I just need to check is this for an additional license for University of Aberdeen or renewal of existing license?

 

They renewed their existing license in January this year (PO-14662).

Colin,

 

It’s ok I won’t mention it . . . I’ll focus on work. ??

 

So, I have had a look and, here are some basics before I get some quotes.

 

 

Available Options & Key Considerations

Option

Details

Considerations

Ekahau Sidekick 2

A dedicated mobile solution for Wi-Fi site surveys

? Ideal for mobile use, accurate and efficient 

? Self-calibrating for precise RF measurements 

? Higher upfront cost compared to using a laptop

Ekahau Connect Subscription

Required if using Sidekick 2 with iOS/Android apps

? Enables use with Ekahau Survey App (iOS/Android) 

? Includes Ekahau Cloud, Analyzer, and Sidekick support 

? Subscription-based cost (1, 3, or 5 years)

Laptop/Tablet + Existing Ekahau Pro

Use a new device to run their existing Ekahau Pro software

? Lower cost if they already have a license 

? Flexibility to choose any hardware 

? Less portable than Sidekick 2 

? May require manual calibration for accuracy

 

I’ll get a quote for each of the options. Have I understood you correctly?

Let me know your thoughts.

 

Ta,

Hi David,

 

As we get our ekahau pro support via yourselves, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible.

 

We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.

 

Thanks,

Colin

Hi Projects,

 

Based on the Blyott quote below we are planning a pilot rollout with Keale University that can easily be extended to cover the whole campus. There are three scenarios plus one nice-to-have for the pilot:

 

Department 

Tracked Assets 

Purpose & Expected Benefits 

Estates Department 

High-value keys 

- Track frequently loaned keys across campus. - Reduce loss and improve accountability for issued keys. - Enable quick retrieval when misplaced. 

Medical School 

4 medical mannequins & control kits 

- Ensure mannequins and kits remain within designated locations. - Track on-campus and off-campus movements (e.g., external training sessions). - Improve retrieval efficiency for misplaced items. 

Library 

High-value reference books 

- Track restricted books that must remain on site. - Improve retrieval of misplaced or hidden books. - Ensure compliance with library policies on restricted item movement. 

Live Transport Monitoring  (Potential Future Expansion) 

Campus bus arrival tracking 

- Explore real-time tracking of campus buses. - Provide live alerts to staff and students when transport arrives. - Improve campus efficiency and scheduling. 

 

 

Alan has confirmed that the Blyott Platform setup fee should cover the creation of locators/locations and we know that there isn’t an existing asset register for us to integrate with, however we would like to maintain our involvement (Alan and I) assisting with Workflow and API integration for instance, and it’s always sensible to have some Qolcom PM oversight. 

 

Can you please suggest a number of days PS/Consultancy and PM for David to add to the quote? 

 

Just call me if you need any clarification. 


Thanks,


Stuart.

Hi David, 

 

Thanks for sending this over. I will pass it on to the team for consideration. 

 

Is this for 100 tags with a max subscription of 500?

 

I think one other question will be around on-going costs:

Could we get an understanding of ongoing costs yearly, lets say if we continued with the current PoC and we expanded the system to cover all of our access points (Approx 2700) with the proposed number of tags.

 

Thanks,

Mat

Hi Mat,

 

Please find attached the quote (QUO-17351) for the Blyott Proof of Concept (PoC) at Keele University. This initial quote is based on a three-month PoC, but we can adjust the term to 6, 9, or 12 months depending on your preference. Let me know what works best for you, and I’ll get updated pricing over to you.

 

To summarise, the PoC will provide tracking capabilities for keys, medical assets, and high-value library books, utilizing 1,000 Aruba AOS10.7.x access points to ensure comprehensive campus coverage. It also includes WebHooks & REST APIs, which could support workflow automation and potential integration with Qolcom Vision if needed.

 

If you have any questions or need any modifications, let me know, and I’ll be happy to assist.

 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

 

Best regards,

David Dunlop

Hi Heidi, 

This isn't the first order we've placed with the vendor no. 

The Vendor has changed their process which is causing a lot of issues with placing orders onto them. 

The Vendor Manager has been in contact with the Vendor Daily trying to sort the issue.

Hi Rebecca

This is now getting ridiculous – is this the first order you’ve placed with the vendor?

Shall I find out if I can get the product from somewhere else instead?

Hi Heidi, 

 

Apologies, i have just looked into this one. 

 

We have been having issues with placing the order onto the vendor, this was never communicated through to me hence why i wasn't able to give you the update as to why you hadn't yet received the licences.

 

Myself and the vendor team are chasing and pushing to sort the issues and for the order to be placed onto the vendor asap.

 

Kind regards,

Hi Rebecca

This is now getting ridiculous – is this the first order you’ve placed with the vendor?

Shall I find out if I can get the product from somewhere else instead?

Hi Heidi, 

 

Apologies, i have just looked into this one. 

 

We have been having issues with placing the order onto the vendor, this was never communicated through to me hence why i wasn't able to give you the update as to why you hadn't yet received the licences.

 

Myself and the vendor team are chasing and pushing to sort the issues and for the order to be placed onto the vendor asap.

 

Kind regards,

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) not available yet

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) not available yet

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) not available yet

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors all plans reissued

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan roof plans of existing block attached

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) no basement, see attached cross section. I have also reissued the plans including the roof plan

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

Subject:	FW: Qolcom - Blyott - PoC of Tags

Hi Projects,

 

Based on the Blyott quote below we are planning a pilot rollout with Keale University that can easily be extended to cover the whole campus. There are three scenarios plus one nice-to-have for the pilot:

 

Department 

Tracked Assets 

Purpose & Expected Benefits 

Estates Department 

High-value keys 

- Track frequently loaned keys across campus. - Reduce loss and improve accountability for issued keys. - Enable quick retrieval when misplaced. 

Medical School 

4 medical mannequins & control kits 

- Ensure mannequins and kits remain within designated locations. - Track on-campus and off-campus movements (e.g., external training sessions). - Improve retrieval efficiency for misplaced items. 

Library 

High-value reference books 

- Track restricted books that must remain on site. - Improve retrieval of misplaced or hidden books. - Ensure compliance with library policies on restricted item movement. 

Live Transport Monitoring  (Potential Future Expansion) 

Campus bus arrival tracking 

- Explore real-time tracking of campus buses. - Provide live alerts to staff and students when transport arrives. - Improve campus efficiency and scheduling. 

 

 

Alan has confirmed that the Blyott Platform setup fee should cover the creation of locators/locations and we know that there isn’t an existing asset register for us to integrate with, however we would like to maintain our involvement (Alan and I) assisting with Workflow and API integration for instance, and it’s always sensible to have some Qolcom PM oversight. 

 

Can you please suggest a number of days PS/Consultancy and PM for David to add to the quote? 

 

Just call me if you need any clarification. 


Thanks,


Stuart.

Hi David, 

 

Thanks for sending this over. I will pass it on to the team for consideration. 

 

Is this for 100 tags with a max subscription of 500?

 

I think one other question will be around on-going costs:

Could we get an understanding of ongoing costs yearly, lets say if we continued with the current PoC and we expanded the system to cover all of our access points (Approx 2700) with the proposed number of tags.

 

Thanks,

Mat

Hi Mat,

 

Please find attached the quote (QUO-17351) for the Blyott Proof of Concept (PoC) at Keele University. This initial quote is based on a three-month PoC, but we can adjust the term to 6, 9, or 12 months depending on your preference. Let me know what works best for you, and I’ll get updated pricing over to you.

 

To summarise, the PoC will provide tracking capabilities for keys, medical assets, and high-value library books, utilizing 1,000 Aruba AOS10.7.x access points to ensure comprehensive campus coverage. It also includes WebHooks & REST APIs, which could support workflow automation and potential integration with Qolcom Vision if needed.

 

If you have any questions or need any modifications, let me know, and I’ll be happy to assist.

 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

 

Best regards,

David Dunlop

Hello gents,

Can you please make sure you have active in date quotes for your Aruba renewals please?  A lot of orders are coming in without them and it's taking the team an age to process.

We're also in the process of aligning out T's and C's with Bechtle's.  Can you check with Keith or Heidi before sending any out to customers please?

Thanks

Ben

Hi Andy,

 

Any joy with this I'm getting a bit of flack from the customer. Anything you can do is much appreciated.

 

Just a thought ... is there anything we can do with eval licenses in the meantime? If so would this cause any issues when the licenses finally arrive?

 

Thanks,

 

David

Hi Mate,

David is still trying to get hold of the SSE licenses from Exclusive but not having much joy. Is there anyone you can nudge on this?

Hi Heidi, 

 

Apologies, i have just looked into this one. 

 

We have been having issues with placing the order onto the vendor, this was never communicated through to me hence why i wasn't able to give you the update as to why you hadn't yet received the licences.

 

Myself and the vendor team are chasing and pushing to sort the issues and for the order to be placed onto the vendor asap.

Ian,

I was supposed to finalise a room for the HPE Aruba road map update on 17th March, but I see he is on holiday this week. Any chance one of you guys can assist in getting a room booked for next Monday? Myself and Simon will be there on the Tuesday 18th as well for the multi-fabric meeting also.

 

Anything you guys can do is much appreciated.

Apologise for the late response, thanks for getting back to me and booking out Ben from 21st April. 

 

Look forward to receiving the HLD, I’ve extended the room on the 18th to enable us to review the HLD. 

 

See you at the kick-off / design workshop and seeing a SOW and detailed delivery plan.

Hi Ian, 

 

We held a meeting in February and we are aware of your May 31st deadline.

 

I spoke to Simon, he is working on your HLD which he hopes to complete by end of play Friday 14th March.  He will get that over to you for review shortly after.  

 

Simon is onsite with Northumbria University staff, for a meeting with HPE on the 18th March, if you could book out a room from about 12 for a working lunch, he will be able to run you through the HLD.  Please be aware he has a 6-hour drive home after that meeting so time will be a little restrictive.

 

Once the HLD is agreed, the next step is to have a kickoff meeting or design workshop with Ben Richards, from which he can create an LLD or SOW before commencing work.

 

We mentioned on the call, but you will not be aware, Qolcom have a large 4 week All hands engagement starting next week, involving all our engineers who will be out of the country, largely without internet access.

 

That said, you will see I have blocked Ben’s calendar out from 21 April through 31 May.  The work won’t take that long and I can refine his time down as we get closer, but it prevents him being assigned to other projects until we iron out our timeline.

Hi Andrew,

 

Thank you for reaching out and as your probably aware I’m keen to getting moving on this given that we have a deadline of 31st May to complete. Can you schedule a kick-off for w/c 17th March, that is giving two weeks to enable Simon to complete the HLD/LLD.

 

Any queries or concerns, please don’t hesitate in contacting me.

 

Thanks & regards

Thanks Kevin.

 

Just as a note, I am currently updating the original HLD document which I produced for City Campus to reflect all of the changes that have either happened or been agreed since then. The document will take into consideration the work that has been completed to date, reference the testing carried out recently and provide a baseline  for us to take forward into the design workshop(s), the production of a revised LLD and then into the implementation and testing phases.

 

There is quite a bit of material that needs to be worked into this document plus changes to the original content so I am going to need a week or so to get it to a place I am comfortable with. 

 

As soon as it is ready I will review it with the team here and get it published to you.

 

Thanks,

Simon

Ian,

I was supposed to finalise a room for the HPE Aruba road map update on 17th March, but I see he is on holiday this week. Any chance one of you guys can assist in getting a room booked for next Monday? Myself and Simon will be there on the Tuesday 18th as well for the multi-fabric meeting also.

 

Anything you guys can do is much appreciated.

 

Thanks,

Hi Andrew,

 

Apologise for the late response, thanks for getting back to me and booking out Ben from 21st April. 

 

Look forward to receiving the HLD, I’ve extended the room on the 18th to enable us to review the HLD. 

 

See you at the kick-off / design workshop and seeing a SOW and detailed delivery plan.

Hi Ian, 

 

We held a meeting in February and we are aware of your May 31st deadline.

 

I spoke to Simon, he is working on your HLD which he hopes to complete by end of play Friday 14th March.  He will get that over to you for review shortly after.  

 

Simon is onsite with Northumbria University staff, for a meeting with HPE on the 18th March, if you could book out a room from about 12 for a working lunch, he will be able to run you through the HLD.  Please be aware he has a 6-hour drive home after that meeting so time will be a little restrictive.

 

Once the HLD is agreed, the next step is to have a kickoff meeting or design workshop with Ben Richards, from which he can create an LLD or SOW before commencing work.

 

We mentioned on the call, but you will not be aware, Qolcom have a large 4 week All hands engagement starting next week, involving all our engineers who will be out of the country, largely without internet access.

 

That said, you will see I have blocked Ben’s calendar out from 21 April through 31 May.  The work won’t take that long and I can refine his time down as we get closer, but it prevents him being assigned to other projects until we iron out our timeline.

Thanks Kevin.

 

Just as a note, I am currently updating the original HLD document which I produced for City Campus to reflect all of the changes that have either happened or been agreed since then. The document will take into consideration the work that has been completed to date, reference the testing carried out recently and provide a baseline  for us to take forward into the design workshop(s), the production of a revised LLD and then into the implementation and testing phases.

 

There is quite a bit of material that needs to be worked into this document plus changes to the original content so I am going to need a week or so to get it to a place I am comfortable with. 

 

As soon as it is ready I will review it with the team here and get it published to you.

 

Thanks,

Simon

Hi Andrew,

 

Apologise for the late response, thanks for getting back to me and booking out Ben from 21st April. 

 

Look forward to receiving the HLD, I’ve extended the room on the 18th to enable us to review the HLD. 

 

See you at the kick-off / design workshop and seeing a SOW and detailed delivery plan.   

 

Thanks Ian

Hi Ian, 

 

We held a meeting in February and we are aware of your May 31st deadline.

 

I spoke to Simon, he is working on your HLD which he hopes to complete by end of play Friday 14th March.  He will get that over to you for review shortly after.  

 

Simon is onsite with Northumbria University staff, for a meeting with HPE on the 18th March, if you could book out a room from about 12 for a working lunch, he will be able to run you through the HLD.  Please be aware he has a 6-hour drive home after that meeting so time will be a little restrictive.

 

Once the HLD is agreed, the next step is to have a kickoff meeting or design workshop with Ben Richards, from which he can create an LLD or SOW before commencing work.

 

We mentioned on the call, but you will not be aware, Qolcom have a large 4 week All hands engagement starting next week, involving all our engineers who will be out of the country, largely without internet access.

 

That said, you will see I have blocked Ben’s calendar out from 21 April through 31 May.  The work won’t take that long and I can refine his time down as we get closer, but it prevents him being assigned to other projects until we iron out our timeline.

 

Regards

 

Andrew Fowler

Hi Andrew,

 

Thank you for reaching out and as your probably aware I’m keen to getting moving on this given that we have a deadline of 31st May to complete. Can you schedule a kick-off for w/c 17th March, that is giving two weeks to enable Simon to complete the HLD/LLD.

 

Any queries or concerns, please don’t hesitate in contacting me.

Jamie, Pete,

 

As discussed yesterday, please see the email below from Mike Sharwin at HPE Aruba. The sfps with those serial numbers are a known issue and can be swapped out.

 

Please let me know if you need anything from me to assist with the RMA.

 

Cheers,

 

David

Morning David, 

 

Please RMA any transceivers with a serial number starting with MY and ‘KBP’ in middle. This issue in known, and transceiver have been updated since then.

Subject: Qolcom - Keele University - SFP Issue 

 

Mike, 

 

Mat has highlighted an issue with their J4858D SFPs. They’ve been troubleshooting low light levels on their fibre links and discovered they’ve got two versions of the transceivers under the same SKU:  

 

CN-prefixed - serials (e.g., CN06KC5NF6): These align with the expected 500m spec.  

MY-prefixed - serials (e.g., MY0BKBP5JT): These seem to max out at 300-330m.  

 

The fibre itself has been checked and is fine, so the shorter-range MY SFPs look to be the issue where installed.  

 

Any idea why there’s a difference between these two? Let me know if you've seen this before and what you think.

 

P.S. The order/quote for the kit in the tender for this SKU does specify 500m. I also had a Google regarding the serial numbers and apparently the prefix denotes the region of manufacture ... CN being China, and MY being Malaysia.

 

 

Cheers,

 

David

Hi Lars/Gery,

 

Apologies for the delay in our response. 

 

I think initially it would be ideal to understand the full costs for 1 year and then make a case for the pilot from there. 

 

Number of APs: 1000 access points running Aruba AOS10.7.x from Central

Number of Tags for keyrings: 50 for Pilot (100 in final solution)

Number of Tags for medical assets (manequins) : 20 for Pilot (200 in final solution)

Number of stickers for Library Books: 20 for Pilot (100+ in Final Solution)

 

Please let me know if you have any more questions about this opportunity. 

 

Thanks,


Stuart.

Hi Lars,

 

Yes, It’s an Aruba infrastructure, with the customer halfway through a migration from AOS8 to AOS10 cloud managed, so will have to work with that. 

 

We need to put a proposal together for a Pilot for the Keys, Medical Assets and Library books with as minimal cost as possible, but understand it will cost something, so a quote from you guys would be great. 

 

Nick is fine, always busy and I am sure he is talking about Blyott to all of his NHS and Logistics customers.

Subject: RE: Keele University - Key Fobs

Hi Lars,

 

Following a call with the customer today we have some more detail on the size of the pilot and some very interesting additional use cases that we can include:

 

The pilot does not need to include student accommodation, just the main campus buildings, which will total approx. 1,000 access points. 

 

Estates Keys

 

The Prime Use case is the tracking of high value keys or sets of keys that get loaned out. 

 

Secondary use cases include:

 

Medical School

 

The University has a medical school (Darwin Building) which has some very high value assets that need to be tracked. For the pilot they will focus on 4 mannequins that are used for teaching. Each mannequin has an associated box of technology paired with it, both mannequin and the box need to be tagged and appropriate workflows be configured. 

 

There is additional kit that will need to be tracked if the pilot is successful including kit that goes into an Ambulance that they use. 

 

The University has a close relationship with Royal Stoke Hospital so this could be a great opportunity to demonstrate Blyott to the NHS. 

 

Library Books

 

There is a requirement to track high value library books that are not allowed to be checked out of the library , but get purposefully misplaced by students. The pilot will need to determine of the system has enough granularity for making this a success

 

As you can see there is some really good opportunity to demonstrate to the University how a campus wide asset tracking solution can be used to solved all sorts of problems. 

 

What are your thoughts?

 

Thanks,


Stuart.

Hi Stuart,

 

We’d like to participate in this, but I think we to insist to broaden the scope of the initial pilot, otherwise we will gain no value in setting this up, I’m sure if they have 2k AP they have a lot of valuable assets that might be interesting to provide with a tag across campus.. ??

Subject: Keele University - Key Fobs

Hi Lars,

 

Based on a conversation with Keele University Estates team at the end of last year, they would very much like to understand the costs to run a pilot for tracking sets of keys around the campus. Bear in mind this is an initial use case and if successful will lead to other uses. 

 

Can we please have some indicative costs for a pilot deployment for the following:

 

*	50 Blyott Tags (Suitable to be attached to a set of keys – BT-T2?). 
*	Integration with a large portion of the Campus, if not all of it, to make the pilot successful. The site has a total of approx. 2,000 access points
*	Blyott Platform access for pilot period

 

Note: There will be no Asset register integration required as the University do not currently record the Keys in an asset registry other than a databased, so we can add all Asset information manually. 

 

If you have any further questions about this then do not hesitate to contact David or Myself. 

 

Best Regards,


Stuart.

Hi Silva, 

 

Cumberland Council have reached out to Qolcom to respond to the attached RFQ, and have reached out to us to support the Cisco renewal. 

 

I have got the renewal quote from Ingram, see attached mail, would you be able to get these quoted on the Qolcom card (I’ll get Heidi/DP to amend the sales person code so you’re recognised) for Qolcom to respond to the RFQ. 

 

We’ll do this on a 50/50 split so I would suggest margin around 5-7%

 

Give me a ring if you have any questions

 

Kind Regards

Hi David, 

Hope you're well.

My name is Conor Binney and I head up Blue Hawk Events. Hope you don’t mind me reaching out. 

I’m just curious to know if Qolcom has any shows or expos coming up? 

We've been assisting global brands like BMW, Mercedes and Bentley with designing, building, and delivering high-quality exhibition stands and experiential events for well over a decade. Aware that these are automotive companies, but we assist many companies in the Wireless space, hence why I thought to reach out.

We have an incredible in-house design team that transforms ideas into reality with high-definition, 3D renders. We'll also film the entire exhibition for you :)  

Appreciate you may not have any shows coming up within the next few weeks (or maybe you do), but there are plenty coming up in 2025 so I thought it may be worthwhile reaching out now to see if you'd like to set things in motion? :)

Hope to hear from you soon. 

Kind regards,

Conor

Bechtle and Qolcom Acquisition Update

Dear Stuart
 
On Monday 7th October 2024, it was announced that Bechtle Limited are acquiring Qolcom.
 
So, as a Qolcom customer, what does this mean for you? We have summarised what will be happening, and when, to ensure you are kept up to date every step of the way.

 

 

 

We will consult with you all the way to ensure a smooth transition. Your key contacts will remain the same. You can be certain that the outstanding service levels you are used to receiving from Qolcom will continue uninterrupted.
 
From 1st March 2025 until the second half of 2026 (date tbc), Qolcom will begin a soft rebrand in collaboration with Bechtle. This means that you will begin to see the wording "Qolcom | Bechtle Group" and the Bechtle Group logo appearing alongside the Qolcom logo. 
 
IMPORTANT: Qolcom will continue to exist as a legally independent company until the merger is complete, and thus also remain the contractual partner for all active contracts.

IMPORTANT CHANGES

What’s changing from 1st March 2025?

What's NOT changing until 2026?

 

*	Company name - Qolcom will become  'Qolcom | Bechtle Group'       
*	Bechtle logo on the Qolcom website
*	Marketing documents will be adjusted to incorporate the new name
*	In 2026, contact e-mail addresses will be updated to follow the Bechtle format (firstname.lastname@bechtle.com <mailto:firstname.lastname@bechtle.com> ) - Qolcom email addresses will still work  

 

*	Legal merger
*	Commercial Register no.
*	Tax no.
*	Bank account holder name
*	Agreements - will migrate 1 for 1
*	Invoices

 



New legal entity from 2026
Over the coming months, we will take steps towards the legal merger of Qolcom into Bechtle Limited, which will become effective in 2026, the official date is to be confirmed. 
We will keep you up to date with how this will work with purchase orders and other documentation.
 
Our Newbury office co-workers will continue to work from the Newbury address as usual, there are no plans for this to change. For you as a customer it will be business as usual.

What's new?
 
Additional support and resources
With this exciting new development for the team, the move also means an increased benefit for you, our customers. As well as offices across 14 countries in Europe, plus an International partnership with the help of their Global IT Alliance, Bechtle Limited. already have 4 UK based offices, with the HQ in Chippenham, a secondary office in Manchester, plus the addition of our Northampton office following the acquisition of ACS Office Solutions, and our London office following the acquisition of Tangible Benefit.

Hi both, 

 

Final one. 

 

Buy price £72,848.30 and sell price is £75,101.34

 

Cant organise the quote to show every individual line as its massive and would probably kill my laptop.

Hi Heidi, 

Apologies, i have just looked into this one. 

We have been having issues with placing the order onto the vendor, this was never communicated through to me hence why i wasn't able to give you the update as to why you hadn't yet received the licences.

Myself and the vendor team are chasing and pushing to sort the issues and for the order to be placed onto the vendor asap.

Kind regards,

Please see attached Infoblox quote for Keele Uni, Keele Uni reached out for this directly, for their Infoblox reporting. Mat at Keele Uni is expecting this. 

 

For simplicity both options, 1GB and 2GB licenses, are on a single quote – we can update the quote once an option has been confirmed.

Subject:	RE: Qolcom - Blyott - PoC of Tags

Morning,

 

I think we can work in general terms. We know it’s 2700 APs. 

 

Out PS should cover:

 

*	AP integration (each AP becomes a connector and is associated with a space name)
*	Zoning (a collection of spaces)
*	Workflows – i.e. alerts for when items leave a zone, or become separated from their paired devices. 
*	Integration (Webhooks and APIs) – definitely some responsibility from them on this regarding their systems and how they will integrate. 

 

To make sure we capture everything I would like to get Alan involved as he understands this. 

 

Can you set up a call between the three of us? Tomorrow afternoon or early next week?

 

Thanks,

 

Stuart.

Stuart,

 

Just so I have understood this correctly . . . Mat wants the scope of the PoC to be expand in terms of coverage to the full campus, so we would need to amend the scope and quote with ps for mapping the Aps? I assume there is a bit of thought that goes into the mapping in terms of locations/zones etc, so if I have understood that correctly, what do we need (if anything) from Mat to be able to cost this?

 

Thanks,

Hi David, 

 

Just re-read this email and understand the additional information. 

 

I think on the full rollout part, we assume the same number of tags for now. Where I'm trying to get to with that, is if we wanted to go campus wide for coverage reasons but not necessarily increase what we were covering to start with. 

 

I know that some of the medical kit for example, isn't going to go in the student accommodation, but they keys might, so I think that's going to be the next logical step for the project before we start to look at adding additional things to locate/track.

 

Thanks for getting this together,

Mat

Hi David, 

 

Thanks for sending this over. I will pass it on to the team for consideration. 

 

Is this for 100 tags with a max subscription of 500?

 

I think one other question will be around on-going costs:

Could we get an understanding of ongoing costs yearly, lets say if we continued with the current PoC and we expanded the system to cover all of our access points (Approx 2700) with the proposed number of tags.

 

Thanks,

Mat

Hi Mat,

 

Please find attached the quote (QUO-17351) for the Blyott Proof of Concept (PoC) at Keele University. This initial quote is based on a three-month PoC, but we can adjust the term to 6, 9, or 12 months depending on your preference. Let me know what works best for you, and I’ll get updated pricing over to you.

 

To summarise, the PoC will provide tracking capabilities for keys, medical assets, and high-value library books, utilizing 1,000 Aruba AOS10.7.x access points to ensure comprehensive campus coverage. It also includes WebHooks & REST APIs, which could support workflow automation and potential integration with Qolcom Vision if needed.

 

If you have any questions or need any modifications, let me know, and I’ll be happy to assist.

 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

 

Best regards,

David Dunlop

Hi Ian, 

 

We held a meeting in February and we are aware of your May 31st deadline.

 

I spoke to Simon, he is working on your HLD which he hopes to complete by end of play Friday 14th March.  He will get that over to you for review shortly after.  

 

Simon is onsite with Northumbria University staff, for a meeting with HPE on the 18th March, if you could book out a room from about 12 for a working lunch, he will be able to run you through the HLD.  Please be aware he has a 6-hour drive home after that meeting so time will be a little restrictive.

 

Once the HLD is agreed, the next step is to have a kickoff meeting or design workshop with Ben Richards, from which he can create an LLD or SOW before commencing work.

 

We mentioned on the call, but you will not be aware, Qolcom have a large 4 week All hands engagement starting next week, involving all our engineers who will be out of the country, largely without internet access.

 

That said, you will see I have blocked Ben’s calendar out from 21 April through 31 May.  The work won’t take that long and I can refine his time down as we get closer, but it prevents him being assigned to other projects until we iron out our timeline.

 

Regards

 

Andrew Fowler

Hi Andrew,

 

Thank you for reaching out and as your probably aware I’m keen to getting moving on this given that we have a deadline of 31st May to complete. Can you schedule a kick-off for w/c 17th March, that is giving two weeks to enable Simon to complete the HLD/LLD.

 

Any queries or concerns, please don’t hesitate in contacting me.

 

Thanks & regards

Thanks Kevin.

 

Just as a note, I am currently updating the original HLD document which I produced for City Campus to reflect all of the changes that have either happened or been agreed since then. The document will take into consideration the work that has been completed to date, reference the testing carried out recently and provide a baseline  for us to take forward into the design workshop(s), the production of a revised LLD and then into the implementation and testing phases.

 

There is quite a bit of material that needs to be worked into this document plus changes to the original content so I am going to need a week or so to get it to a place I am comfortable with. 

 

As soon as it is ready I will review it with the team here and get it published to you.

 

Thanks,

Simon

Subject: Qolcom - Keele University - SFP Issue 

 

Mike, 

 

Mat has highlighted an issue with their J4858D SFPs. They’ve been troubleshooting low light levels on their fibre links and discovered they’ve got two versions of the transceivers under the same SKU:  

 

CN-prefixed - serials (e.g., CN06KC5NF6): These align with the expected 500m spec.  

MY-prefixed - serials (e.g., MY0BKBP5JT): These seem to max out at 300-330m.  

 

The fibre itself has been checked and is fine, so the shorter-range MY SFPs look to be the issue where installed.  

 

Any idea why there’s a difference between these two? Let me know if you've seen this before and what you think.

 

P.S. The order/quote for the kit in the tender for this SKU does specify 500m. I also had a Google regarding the serial numbers and apparently the prefix denotes the region of manufacture ... CN being China, and MY being Malaysia.

 

 

Cheers,

 

David

Hi Andrew,

 

Thank you for reaching out and as your probably aware I’m keen to getting moving on this given that we have a deadline of 31st May to complete. Can you schedule a kick-off for w/c 17th March, that is giving two weeks to enable Simon to complete the HLD/LLD.

 

Any queries or concerns, please don’t hesitate in contacting me.

Thanks Kevin.

 

Just as a note, I am currently updating the original HLD document which I produced for City Campus to reflect all of the changes that have either happened or been agreed since then. The document will take into consideration the work that has been completed to date, reference the testing carried out recently and provide a baseline  for us to take forward into the design workshop(s), the production of a revised LLD and then into the implementation and testing phases.

 

There is quite a bit of material that needs to be worked into this document plus changes to the original content so I am going to need a week or so to get it to a place I am comfortable with. 

 

As soon as it is ready I will review it with the team here and get it published to you.

 

Thanks,

Simon

Hi David, 

Just re-read this email and understand the additional information. 

I think on the full rollout part, we assume the same number of tags for now. Where I'm trying to get to with that, is if we wanted to go campus wide for coverage reasons but not necessarily increase what we were covering to start with. 

I know that some of the medical kit for example, isn't going to go in the student accommodation, but they keys might, so I think that's going to be the next logical step for the project before we start to look at adding additional things to locate/track.

Thanks for getting this together,
Mat

Hi David, 

 

Thanks for sending this over. I will pass it on to the team for consideration. 

 

Is this for 100 tags with a max subscription of 500?

 

I think one other question will be around on-going costs:

Could we get an understanding of ongoing costs yearly, lets say if we continued with the current PoC and we expanded the system to cover all of our access points (Approx 2700) with the proposed number of tags.

 

Thanks,

Mat

Hi Mat,

 

Please find attached the quote (QUO-17351) for the Blyott Proof of Concept (PoC) at Keele University. This initial quote is based on a three-month PoC, but we can adjust the term to 6, 9, or 12 months depending on your preference. Let me know what works best for you, and I’ll get updated pricing over to you.

 

To summarise, the PoC will provide tracking capabilities for keys, medical assets, and high-value library books, utilizing 1,000 Aruba AOS10.7.x access points to ensure comprehensive campus coverage. It also includes WebHooks & REST APIs, which could support workflow automation and potential integration with Qolcom Vision if needed.

 

If you have any questions or need any modifications, let me know, and I’ll be happy to assist.

Thanks Kevin.

 

Just as a note, I am currently updating the original HLD document which I produced for City Campus to reflect all of the changes that have either happened or been agreed since then. The document will take into consideration the work that has been completed to date, reference the testing carried out recently and provide a baseline  for us to take forward into the design workshop(s), the production of a revised LLD and then into the implementation and testing phases.

 

There is quite a bit of material that needs to be worked into this document plus changes to the original content so I am going to need a week or so to get it to a place I am comfortable with. 

 

As soon as it is ready I will review it with the team here and get it published to you.

 

Thanks,

Simon

Hi Kevin, Len, David, Tharanga, Gavin,  

 

Following on from Mike’s email, we propose to attend Northumbria University on Monday, 17th March (with HPE Aruba) for a session covering the HPE Aruba roadmap, strategy, and technology discussions.  

 

This visit will complement the Fabric-focused session scheduled for the 18th March with Joe Neville and provide a broader overview of Aruba’s direction, aligning with your networking plans. We’d be happy to tailor the agenda based on any specific areas you’d like us to cover.  

 

Please let us know if this date works for you and if there are any key topics you’d like us to prioritise.  

 

Looking forward to your thoughts.  

 

Best regards,  

 

David

Hi Kevin, Len, David, Tharanga, Gavin, 

 

Good to see you all on the call last week. 

 

I’m in the area with Joe Neville, Aruba Technology Strategist focussed on Fabric Networks week commencing 17th March. We are available to come to campus for a meeting during the morning of the 18th (09:00-11:00) if this works for yourselves?

 

This would be supplementary to the broader session we are planning with Qolcom, however I think it will be valuable to also meet with Joe, specifically on the subject of Fabrics given his expertise in this area, your current core project and potential options to expand this to the edge of the network in future.

 

Please kindly let me know asap if we can get this arranged?

 

FYI – Joe has also posted an EVPN-VXLAN explainer on the Aruba Airheads Broadcasting Channel which may be of interest to you. I have had very positive feedback on this from other customers who are beginning to deploy fabrics;

Subject:	proposals etc.

Morning All,

 

All documentation is in the process of being updated.

 

So far, I have updated some of the boilerplate proposals below on SharePoint with the new logo and colours. I have also added in a short section, “about Bechtle” and an intro one liner.

 

 Enhanced Support Proposal_Template_updated August 2024_KR.docx <https://qolcom.sharepoint.com/:w:/s/QolcomIntranet/Pre-Sales/EQcaV1wJtIhFkduQeJ901soBWZmP7bllbHhyG0E2IS0Z9A?e=0i72T4>

Kelly has updated Dynamics with the new logo and colours so all new quotes/invoices will be in the new look n feel along with the Intranet.

 

Andy has updated all websites with the new logo and colours. https://qolcom.co.uk/ (just Support page – Vivantio – left to do)

 

The news page has been updated with the new logo and colours https://blog.qolcom.co.uk/?utm_campaign=blog&mtm_source=qolcom

 

For reference the new logos are located in Marketing here   Qolcom_Logo <https://qolcom.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/QolcomIntranet/Marketing/ErUC1ujiGN5EqjxKmYbepVYB_bZnEAsxktenHx5Tl4LgnQ?e=tWkPFh> 

 

Linked In branding is located here:  Linked In Branding <https://qolcom.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/QolcomIntranet/Marketing/EqTh1ej9g8JKr0m_yy0Ltc8B9ie_T3er2lnYV_mUA6p5qg?e=ahH5y9> 

 

For the adventurous people, the colour codes for the 2 greens in the logo are (I use the RGB codes as easiest) :

 



Let me know if you need any assistance formatting/new colours etc.. for proposals/project/Support documents or help with Linked In etc.

Ben,

 

I have a quote request from Cumberland for Aruba and Cisco kit . . . Can we get a competitive quote for Cisco kit from Bechtle? This could end up a complete refresh of 4 councils that have merged . . . .

Subject:	RE: Durham DBFO project at Hild Bede and Elvet Hill

Hi David,

 

Based on what we have seen so far the quote is as follows:

 

QAR-PROJECT

Project Management

2

£850.00

QAD-RF-SURV-R

RF Site Survey – Remote RF Site Survey

5

£600.00

QAD-RF-SURV-O

RF Site Survey – On Site RF Site Survey

10

£650.00

QAD-EXPENSES

Travel & Expenses

10

£100.00

 

This is based on all locations listed in the following location  Durham University Hild Bede and Elvet Hill Planning and Surveys.xlsx <https://qolcom.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/QolcomIntranet/Accounts/ETo62Fsi3EhKtoBDIAGdh-4B6B1AYlpq7nWROHzswQWsqw?e=seqhAy> 

 

As a rough estimate for the locations we haven’t received plans for yet I’d suggest going for 2 days additional remote and 5 days additional on site with expenses.

 

Thanks

Shane

Tim,

 

 

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) 

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) 

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) 

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors 

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan 

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) 

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

Hi David, 

 

Thanks for clarification.

 

I have attached a quote for the Ekahau Suite for you.

 

Depending on what they are trying to achieve they could need AI Pro and Connect as well as the Sidekick, but it’s not clear from Colin’s reply.

 

Happy to jump on a call if support is needed.

Michael,

 

Thanks for getting back to me and nice to meet you too. ??

 

Yes, this is in addition to their renewal from January. Below is what Colin sent to me . . .

 

“Hi David, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible. We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.”

 

I have replied to Colin with the options, so hopefully that all makes sense.

 

Thanks,

Hi David, 

Thanks for sending this over. I will pass it on to the team for consideration. 

Is this for 100 tags with a max subscription of 500?

I think one other question will be around on-going costs:
Could we get an understanding of ongoing costs yearly, lets say if we continued with the current PoC and we expanded the system to cover all of our access points (Approx 2700) with the proposed number of tags.

Thanks,
Mat

Hi Mat,

 

Please find attached the quote (QUO-17351) for the Blyott Proof of Concept (PoC) at Keele University. This initial quote is based on a three-month PoC, but we can adjust the term to 6, 9, or 12 months depending on your preference. Let me know what works best for you, and I’ll get updated pricing over to you.

 

To summarise, the PoC will provide tracking capabilities for keys, medical assets, and high-value library books, utilizing 1,000 Aruba AOS10.7.x access points to ensure comprehensive campus coverage. It also includes WebHooks & REST APIs, which could support workflow automation and potential integration with Qolcom Vision if needed.

 

If you have any questions or need any modifications, let me know, and I’ll be happy to assist.

 

Looking forward to your thoughts.

 

Best regards,

David Dunlop

David,

John has been working on the PoC from our side but he's on leave this week due to half term, I've got a catchup arranged with him on Tuesday so I'll be in a better position to answer questions then.

[EXTERNAL EMAIL]

Hi Andrew, 

 

I messaged you the other week to see if we could get a catch up regarding the ClearPass project. We had a call earlier with Glen about things in general and we had a few questions, but he suggested catching up with yourself regarding the security/ClearPass project. Do you have any time for a call with myself and Mike Ashby? Just for an update and we can share what we've done so far. 

 

Thanks,

Hi David,

 

Thank you for this information.

 

Good to know that you are reviewing client infrastructure and ensuring that everything is covered with support where needed as well as co-terming contracts where appropriate. Please keep us informed on the offer preparation and let us know when it would be sent to pricing from Aruba side, so we can turn them over back to you asap.

 

If there is anything more we can help with, please let us know.

 

Best regards,

Subject: RE: Durham University, Aruba Support Renewal

 

Hi Eliska,

 

Apologies for not replying sooner but thank you for following up and for providing the renewal quotes. We really appreciate the effort in getting these options over to us.

 

I just wanted to clarify that while these quotes are certainly useful, they represent only a small part of Durham University's overall support renewal. While they might seem like straightforward renewal options, the situation is more complex, as their full renewal involves multiple elements that need to be considered together. We have a structured process for support renewals, ensuring that everything is reviewed as a whole and co-termed where appropriate. This helps maintain consistency, simplifies ongoing management for the customer, and ensures the best overall outcome. That process is already in place, and we are currently working on finalising the full support renewal quote for Durham University.

 

Their renewal date remains April 1st, so we are actively working towards providing them with a comprehensive and aligned proposal.

 

I will let you know how we get on.

 

Best regards,
 

David Dunlop

Morning all,

 

I'm afraid I haven't received anything regarding this yet, however I have passed the email along to our customer service team to see if they have received anything from westcoast yet.

 

I'll let you know as soon as I have anything.

 

Thanks,

Morning all,

 

I'm afraid I haven't received anything regarding this yet, however I have passed the email along to our customer service team to see if they have received anything from westcoast yet.

 

I'll let you know as soon as I have anything.

 

Thanks,

 

David

Tim,

 

 

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) 

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) 

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) 

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors 

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan 

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) 

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

Hi Ben, I can only get a room from 12 on this date (but have asked a couple of people if they definitely need the rooms they have booked AM!).  If this works, we still have the afternoon, and it will be great to meet you and the team.  I will send a guide agenda, for you to tweak around what we discussed, and look forward to seeing you all then!

@Lee, Alice<mailto:alice.lee@bechtle.com> You are welcome to join us – I will copy you when I send the agenda!

Thank you,
Viki

Hi David, 

 

Yes – it’s almost word-for-word the version we sent them in June 2024.

 

The proposed models and design guidelines are still current. It includes the full range of 6xx-series APs. We wouldn’t change that at the moment. The 7xx-series are still very new with limited models plus require AOS 10 which Durham isn’t ready with. 

 

Thanks,

Mike

Hi David,

 

Yes. Looks like Sidekick2 and ekahau connect subscription (1/3/5years) cost options required.

 

Thanks,

Colin,

 

It’s ok I won’t mention it . . . I’ll focus on work. ??

 

So, I have had a look and, here are some basics before I get some quotes.

 

 

Available Options & Key Considerations

Option

Details

Considerations

Ekahau Sidekick 2

A dedicated mobile solution for Wi-Fi site surveys

? Ideal for mobile use, accurate and efficient 

? Self-calibrating for precise RF measurements 

? Higher upfront cost compared to using a laptop

Ekahau Connect Subscription

Required if using Sidekick 2 with iOS/Android apps

? Enables use with Ekahau Survey App (iOS/Android) 

? Includes Ekahau Cloud, Analyzer, and Sidekick support 

? Subscription-based cost (1, 3, or 5 years)

Laptop/Tablet + Existing Ekahau Pro

Use a new device to run their existing Ekahau Pro software

? Lower cost if they already have a license 

? Flexibility to choose any hardware 

? Less portable than Sidekick 2 

? May require manual calibration for accuracy

 

I’ll get a quote for each of the options. Have I understood you correctly?

Let me know your thoughts.

 

Ta,

	Caution: External email. Do not open attachments or click links, unless this email comes from a known sender and you know the content is safe. 

 

Hi David,

 

As we get our ekahau pro support via yourselves, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible.

 

We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.

 

Thanks,

Colin

Tim,

 

 

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) not available yet

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) not available yet

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) not available yet

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors all plans reissued

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan roof plans of existing block attached

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) no basement, see attached cross section. I have also reissued the plans including the roof plan

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

Hi David,

 

As we get our ekahau pro support via yourselves, would you be able to supply a quote for an Ekahau Sidekick 2? I’m not sure if we also need an “ekahau connect subscription” with this or not – I think it could be required if we want to use the iOS/Android apps with sidekick, so perhaps worth adding that on as well if possible.

 

We may just end up purchasing a new laptop/tablet and putting our existing ekahau pro on that, but a dedicated sidekick 2 would seem the more ideal mobile solution, if we can afford it.

 

Thanks,

Colin

Tim,

 

 

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following: 

 

- DU3 - 19th College 

- Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1) 

- Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2) 

- 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1) 

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad 

- Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors 

- Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan 

- Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable) 

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of? 

 

Thanks,

 

David

Tim,

 

 

I've been reviewing the plans received so far, and I wanted to check if you could confirm which plans we are still waiting for. Based on our records, we believe we are still missing the following:  

 

- DU3 - 19th College  

  - Main West Block (DU3-NOR-B1)  

  - Main East Block (DU3-NOR-B2)  

  - 19th College Heart (DU3-NOR-H1)  

 

- DU4 - Gilesgate Post-Grad  

  - Any additional plans for Manor House (DU4-NOR-B2), particularly separate breakdowns for ground and first floors  

  - Belvedere (DU4-NOR-B3) Roof Plan  

  - Block 5 (DU4-NOR-B5) Basement Plan (if applicable)  

 

Can you confirm if we should expect these, or if there are any other outstanding plans we need to be aware of?  

 

Thanks,

 

David

Hi Kevin, Len, David, Tharanga, Gavin, 

 

Good to see you all on the call last week. 

 

I’m in the area with Joe Neville, Aruba Technology Strategist focussed on Fabric Networks week commencing 17th March. We are available to come to campus for a meeting during the morning of the 18th (09:00-11:00) if this works for yourselves?

 

This would be supplementary to the broader session we are planning with Qolcom, however I think it will be valuable to also meet with Joe, specifically on the subject of Fabrics given his expertise in this area, your current core project and potential options to expand this to the edge of the network in future.

 

Please kindly let me know asap if we can get this arranged?

 

FYI – Joe has also posted an EVPN-VXLAN explainer on the Aruba Airheads Broadcasting Channel which may be of interest to you. I have had very positive feedback on this from other customers who are beginning to deploy fabrics;

	Caution: External email. Do not open attachments or click links, unless this email comes from a known sender and you know the content is safe. 


Hi Kevin, Len, David, Tharanga, Gavin, 

 

Good to see you all on the call last week. 

 

I’m in the area with Joe Neville, Aruba Technology Strategist focussed on Fabric Networks week commencing 17th March. We are available to come to campus for a meeting during the morning of the 18th (09:00-11:00) if this works for yourselves?

 

This would be supplementary to the broader session we are planning with Qolcom, however I think it will be valuable to also meet with Joe, specifically on the subject of Fabrics given his expertise in this area, your current core project and potential options to expand this to the edge of the network in future.

 

Please kindly let me know asap if we can get this arranged?

 

FYI – Joe has also posted an EVPN-VXLAN explainer on the Aruba Airheads Broadcasting Channel which may be of interest to you. I have had very positive feedback on this from other customers who are beginning to deploy fabrics;

It’s a lot easier to do a bulk edit within Dynamics now. 

 

So if you need to deactivate a contact altogether just select them all and then you can bulk deactivate at the top.

 

Or if you want to mark as ‘do not send marketing materials’ you can select and go to edit and make the changes for them all at the same time.

Kelly,

 

Can you please see if you can export my contacts into an excel spreadsheet and share it with me? It's easier to look through. I'll then mark it up and send back for you to import?

 

Is that ok?

Afternoon all,

 

Can you please confirm to Kelly as soon as you have done this please?  We don't want to get blacklisted from email servers due to poorly updated accounts.

 

Make sure contacts have an email address. If you have leavers mark them as inactive.

 

Thanks

Subject: Important - Contacts Data in Dynamics 

 

Hi All,

 

As Keith has mentioned, we shall be sending out an emailer next week to update customers on the timeline of the merger with Bechtle.

 

I’m not sure how up to date your contacts are on Dynamics so please could you double check them before we send out the emails?

 

I have created a view for each of you in your contacts called ‘MKTG Active Contacts – (Your Initials)’.  In that view you will see if a contact has ‘Send Marketing Materials’ or ‘Do Not Send Marketing Materials’ against them.

 

Any contacts that have ‘Send’ against will receive the mailer. If that flag needs to be amended, please do so. 

 

Let me know if you have any questions. 

 

Thanks,

 

Kelly

If its no use please let me know either way . . . I can take it. ??

Hi Alex and Paul,  

I hope you’re both doing well and that the start of the year hasn’t been too hectic!  

I just wanted to follow up on the Network Equipment RFI we submitted in January to see if there are any updates on next steps. We appreciate that this was an early market engagement exercise, but I wanted to check if there’s been any further discussion around potential timelines for a formal procurement process.  

No rush at all, but if there’s anything we should be aware of or any further input needed from our side, just let me know. Looking forward to catching up soon.  

Regards,

Apologies for the delay in getting this to you. I am also just waiting on Stel from Westcoast to tell me how many AP-587s you can get for the swap out. Hopefully won’t be long.

I have chased him again this afternoon.

Hi David, 

 

Could we get this quote changed please to be:

 

6 x AP-270-MNT-H3

1 x AP-270-MNT-H1

 

And if you can make sure Kate is copied in, we can get it raised next week.

Hi David, 

 

We have 12 AP585's remaining that we would like to swap for AP587. Could you let us know how many AP587s we could get by returning these please?

 

These are the serial numbers:

CNQGL1M02V

CNQGL1M06H

CNPSL1M01T

CNQGL1M03Y

CNQGL1M04D

CNQGL1M06G

CNQGL1M00G

CNQGL1M06F

CNQGL1M035

CNQGL1M06L

CNPSL1M01B

CNQGL1M055

 

They are all still boxed and haven't been undone.

 

We are also looking for a couple of extra AP-270-MNT-H1 mounts. Could we get a price for these please?

 

Thanks,

Mat

Hi David,

I understand that as a sales leader, you are directly responsible for hiring and enabling the right sales talent required to achieve your revenue objectives. In an established organisation, you may have internal recruiters and sales enablement resource to support you with this challenge. However, sometimes you don't have this resource, or it may not be of the standard that you require.

At DynamicWhale, we provide expert external support with hiring and enabling sales professionals, based on extensive first-hand experience in software sales. We have large global network of elite sales professionals across EMEA and North America, and an industry-leading enablement program to ensure that they ramp up as quickly as possible.

If you are currently struggling to find the right people to fill your open roles, or you feel that your existing team would benefit from expert enablement in areas such as pipeline generation or qualification, the I would love to understand your requirements to explore how we can support you moving forward.


I figured you might be interested in getting a message - if I made a mistake just respond 'STOP'

Stel,

 

I have the quote for the Keele University Aps now. Can you help me understand what they can get for swapping out 12 x AP-585 aps?

Based on Mat Bailey’s request, Keele University is looking to achieve the following:

 

Objectives:

1.	Swap Access Points

	*	Exchange 12x AP-585 units for AP-587 models.
	*	Ensure the best possible swap ratio (likely considering value or stock availability).
	*	All AP-585 units are unused and still boxed, which may facilitate the swap.

 

Thanks,

Kelly,

 

Just spoke to Stuart Mo . . . he is going to get the serial numbers for the AP-=303s and send them over.

 

Also . . . I was just thinking, as they have 10 x AP-505s in stock and not installed yet, do they not still need to be paying for software updates? Or only once they start using them?

 

Thanks,

Hi David,

 

The renewal is for the x525 AP’s he purchased 3 years ago. 

 

If we need to remove x15 of them and add x24 303’s then I will need an export of the serials as PBS is backed off against specific AP’s.

 

The cost price probably won’t be that different but I need to back off the right kit.

 

Thanks,

Hi folks

Thanks all for joining the call this morning. 

 

Attached are the slides I went through. Please note, these are strictly NDA so please don’t share outside your own organization. On the questions that arose, @Mike Ashby <mailto:mashby@qolcom.co.uk>  I’ve shared the 5420 slides with you with regards to 25Gb support. The other question was around PBS and any other additional discounts afforded to PBS partners on the 8325H promo. I’ve gone through the slides and unfortunately not. I’ve added in the Terms and Conditions of sale on there so you can see.

 

I think that’s it, but let me know if anything else pops up.

Hi All,

 

As Keith has mentioned, we shall be sending out an emailer next week to update customers on the timeline of the merger with Bechtle.

 

I’m not sure how up to date your contacts are on Dynamics so please could you double check them before we send out the emails?

 

I have created a view for each of you in your contacts called ‘MKTG Active Contacts – (Your Initials)’.  In that view you will see if a contact has ‘Send Marketing Materials’ or ‘Do Not Send Marketing Materials’ against them.

 

Any contacts that have ‘Send’ against will receive the mailer. If that flag needs to be amended, please do so. 

 

Let me know if you have any questions. 

 

Thanks,

 

Kelly

The reason they are on 8.10 is because that is the last software release that supports the 200 series APs that they have. 8.12 is out and has superseded 8.10 as a sustained release and this will be the last sustained release in Aruba OSv8. This supports all their APs except for the 200 series.

Alan,

 

I've been sent this for the renewal quote for Cumberland Council, but I've shared it with Kelly to see how it compares to what she has. 

 

However, I was hoping that you could have a quick look at what they have and make some observations? For example, I see they have some 200 series access points, and they are also on AOS 8.10. I'm sure that's fine for now but if you could have a look over it and let me know your thoughts on anything I should probably include in my response regarding end of sale/life and support.

 

 

Thanks,

Soft Rebranding


We are in the process of sending out an email to all our customer contacts and suppliers advising them that from 1st March 2025 until the second half of 2026 (date tbc), Qolcom will begin a soft rebrand in collaboration with Bechtle. This means that you will begin to see the wording "Qolcom | Bechtle Group" and the Bechtle Group logo appearing alongside the Qolcom logo.

 

IMPORTANT: Qolcom will continue to exist as a legally independent company until the merger is complete, and thus also remain the contractual partner for all active contracts.

 

We are currently working on:

*	rebranding the Qolcom websites (.co.uk, vision, connect)

*	Dynamics quotes/invoice templates see here <https://qolcom.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/QolcomIntranet/Marketing/Ec9iM2uhEbBImCkDUWzzMZgBWQff1aIX6UIVdJpwBWsZiw?e=SUcWzk> 

 

All proposals, engineering docs, project docs and support docs will adopt the new branding as of 1st March

 

IMPORTANT - WE WILL NOT BE DISPLAYING OR USING THE NEW LOGO UNTIL AFTER MARCH 1st (which is a Saturday :-)

Hi David, 

 

The communication was issued on the 11th Feb and the RFI has now been archived and can’t be accessed.  The message was:

 

The University would like to express thanks for your involvement in this RFI exercise. Your responses have given great insight into your products, and to the wider market in general, and we now have sufficient information to confirm our next steps. 

 

We will shortly proceed to a closed RfP exercise which may lead to a formal product selection, and you will be informed separately if your product is being considered for this additional stage of the procurement exercise. As such, there will be no further communication via this RFI within the University In Tend system and it will shortly be closed. 

 

Please don’t hesitate to ask if you have any further questions and thank you for the time and effort put into your contributions to this exercise.

 

Kind regards

Hi Lee,

I am hoping you can help me. I received an email from the University of Manchester procurement system regarding a "correspondence notification" related to the project: Partner to Provide Network Equipment and Related Professional Services - Request for Information (RFI). The email states: "New correspondence has been published to the secure area of The University of Manchester website. Click this link to go to the website."

I assumed this to the In-Tend portal, where we originally submitted our response, I logged in but could not find any new correspondence related to this RFI. Could you kindly confirm, if I am looking in the wrong place for the correspondence? Or if the RFI status has changed (e.g., closed, withdrawn, or replaced)?

I appreciate your time and assistance in clarifying this. Please let me know if you need any further details.

Best regards,

David Dunlop

Hi mate, 

 

Does this mean they’re running with the POC themselves or have we been given the go-ahead? I think the days were pretty much covered from the previous PO.

 

I see we have our monthly call with Durham tomorrow. Speak to you then if not before .

 

Cheers,

Hi David

 

Hope all is well. 

 

Just tried to contact you the previous days regarding the request for a statement as I am still investigating this.

 

Would it be possible to provide some additional details including customer, type of support renewal (e.g. is it PBS or FC), what the customer is looking to get from us as a statement?

 

Will then share this with the relevant team to see what it could be provided.

 

Many thanks

Hi Keith,

 

We have some information about Qolcom's outcomes in this article <https://blog.qolcom.co.uk/sustainable-digital-network-transformation-at-keele-university/>  we published on the blog, but we may need additional details. Could you please provide any information that would help us ensure CS is properly 'Qolcomised'?

We do have a bit more to add that is more Qolcom outcomes rather than just feeds and speeds, that would be nice to weave into the case study.

Simon,

 

Remy will send an updated quote with the quantity of the options “0”.

AD is indeed not needed, but pricing should not have been included.

 

The MoQ for licenses is indeed always 500; the MoQ for tags is 100 (but we can be flexible for the hardware e.g. combination). 

As indicated before: we don’t do “PoC’s”, this is the min. we propose but the client can cancel “if not happy” after 3 months.

Hi Simon,

 

Just a query. 


Do we need the active directory part codes? We are not planning on integration with AD at this point. 

 

Why is there a 500 tag subscription for 100 tags over 3 months – is that a minimum level?

 

Thanks,


Stu.

Good afternoon and I hope you are well. 

 

Following on from the interchanges between yourself and Blyott, please see the attached. 

 

Gery has confirmed that even though his quotation is offering the T2 tags, he will happily supply whichever tags are needed (as per the below, youd suggest: T2, tiny tags and possibly sticker tags). 

 

Everything has been quoted against three months so, if you would need the costs for 12 months, its simple multiplication based on subscription costs, webhooks and Rest APIs

 

If you should need anything else or, should have any further questions – please give me a call or drop me a mail.

Hi Lars/Gery,

 

Apologies for the delay in our response. 

 

I think initially it would be ideal to understand the full costs for 1 year and then make a case for the pilot from there. 

 

Number of APs: 1000 access points running Aruba AOS10.7.x from Central

Number of Tags for keyrings: 50 for Pilot (100 in final solution)

Number of Tags for medical assets (manequins) : 20 for Pilot (200 in final solution)

Number of stickers for Library Books: 20 for Pilot (100+ in Final Solution)

 

Please let me know if you have any more questions about this opportunity. 

 

Thanks,


Stuart.

Hi Lars,

 

Yes, It’s an Aruba infrastructure, with the customer halfway through a migration from AOS8 to AOS10 cloud managed, so will have to work with that. 

 

We need to put a proposal together for a Pilot for the Keys, Medical Assets and Library books with as minimal cost as possible, but understand it will cost something, so a quote from you guys would be great. 

 

Nick is fine, always busy and I am sure he is talking about Blyott to all of his NHS and Logistics customers. 

 

Thanks,

Hi Stuart,

 

Sounds promising, any idea about numbers/budget – WIFI infrastructure I assume ARUBA?

 

What do you expect from us to make this happen? Can we quote something?

 

BTW – how is Nick doing, been a while since I heard from our talkative friend.. ??

Subject: RE: Keele University - Key Fobs

Hi Lars,

 

Following a call with the customer today we have some more detail on the size of the pilot and some very interesting additional use cases that we can include:

 

The pilot does not need to include student accommodation, just the main campus buildings, which will total approx. 1,000 access points. 

 

Estates Keys

 

The Prime Use case is the tracking of high value keys or sets of keys that get loaned out. 

 

Secondary use cases include:

 

Medical School

 

The University has a medical school (Darwin Building) which has some very high value assets that need to be tracked. For the pilot they will focus on 4 mannequins that are used for teaching. Each mannequin has an associated box of technology paired with it, both mannequin and the box need to be tagged and appropriate workflows be configured. 

 

There is additional kit that will need to be tracked if the pilot is successful including kit that goes into an Ambulance that they use. 

 

The University has a close relationship with Royal Stoke Hospital so this could be a great opportunity to demonstrate Blyott to the NHS. 

 

Library Books

 

There is a requirement to track high value library books that are not allowed to be checked out of the library , but get purposefully misplaced by students. The pilot will need to determine of the system has enough granularity for making this a success

 

As you can see there is some really good opportunity to demonstrate to the University how a campus wide asset tracking solution can be used to solved all sorts of problems. 

 

What are your thoughts?

 

Thanks,


Stuart.

Hi Stuart,

 

We’d like to participate in this, but I think we to insist to broaden the scope of the initial pilot, otherwise we will gain no value in setting this up, I’m sure if they have 2k AP they have a lot of valuable assets that might be interesting to provide with a tag across campus.. ??

Subject: Keele University - Key Fobs

Hi Lars,

 

Based on a conversation with Keele University Estates team at the end of last year, they would very much like to understand the costs to run a pilot for tracking sets of keys around the campus. Bear in mind this is an initial use case and if successful will lead to other uses. 

 

Can we please have some indicative costs for a pilot deployment for the following:

 

*	50 Blyott Tags (Suitable to be attached to a set of keys – BT-T2?). 
*	Integration with a large portion of the Campus, if not all of it, to make the pilot successful. The site has a total of approx. 2,000 access points
*	Blyott Platform access for pilot period

 

Note: There will be no Asset register integration required as the University do not currently record the Keys in an asset registry other than a databased, so we can add all Asset information manually. 

 

If you have any further questions about this then do not hesitate to contact David or Myself. 

 

Best Regards,


Stuart.

Hi David, 

 

You mention Elvet Hill and Hild Bede however all the drawings (16) are named Elvet Hill!

 

We have:

 

Elvet Hill B1 Level 00 – Level 04 (5)

Elvet Hill B2 Level 00 – Level 04 (5)

Elvet Hill B3 Level B1 – Level 04 (6)

 

Nothing seen that mentions Hild Bede, is that correct?

 

Cheers

Thanks Aj, & hi Ben, 

 

Happy to run you through our platform. It will likely take around an hour.  I can do any time PM Thursday or Friday or PM next week with the exception of Wednesday. 

 

Do you want to let me know when is best? Once confirmed I will send out a Teams meeting to all.

Hi Ajay,


Thank you again for yesterday.  Great to better understand the Bechtle proposition.

 

I’ve followed up with the team today and I know the guys are very interested in seeing the Bechtle Direct portal, understand how it can be customised as well as having a deep dive in to the pillars.  I’ll follow up with you to work out a few dates where we may be able to organise some additional sessions.

 

Have a good weekend all!

	Sorry mate, I was in the middle of a few things trying to get somethings out. I know it's a lot, but I was just trying to get across that it still has a big focus on the Aruba solutions and not so much our capabilities and value.

	If you can wait until tomorrow I'll have more time to see what sections we can amend and include a bit more about ourselves and our added value? Let me have a look tonight and catch up tomorrow.

	Subject: RE: Keele Case Study – A Couple of Thoughts

	 

	Keith,

	 

	The case study looks good. Qolcom’s role comes through a lot more, and it ties in well with Keele’s long-term vision. A couple of things that I thought of:

	 

	*	Why Qolcom? In terms of showing our contribution, its much better, but there’s still quite a bit of focus on Aruba’s solutions. What about a short section explicitly highlighting what sets Qolcom apart, our strategic input, security expertise, and long-term support, could help highlight our value better?

	 

	*	Making it more accessible – I’m not sure about this one but I do always try and think about who was reading it and what level they are, because some of the more technical sections (AOS10 migration, ClearPass security) might be a bit heavy for non-technical readers. Maybe a short executive summary at the start could help frame the key takeaways in a way that resonates with a broader audience.

	 

	A brief idea of what I meant below . . .
	
	Why Qolcom? A Strategic Partner in Smart Campus Transformation

	While cutting-edge technology is critical to Keele University’s smart campus vision, the true value lies in the expertise and strategic guidance behind its deployment. Qolcom goes beyond simply implementing Aruba solutions—we ensure that the network is optimized, secure, and future-proofed for Keele’s evolving needs.

	Unlike traditional resellers, Qolcom is a trusted technology partner with deep expertise in higher education digital transformation, network security, and cloud-managed networking. Our hands-on approach, from design consultation to ongoing lifecycle management, allows Keele to maximize its investment and continuously innovate.

	 

	What Sets Qolcom Apart?

	 

	? Consultative Approach – We worked closely with Keele’s IT team to align Aruba technology with their broader sustainability and smart campus roadmap.
	? Security & Compliance Expertise – Our engineers ensured a robust, role-based access framework using ClearPass, securing thousands of student and IoT connections.
	? Aruba Central & AOS10 Migration Leadership – We advised Keele on their transition to cloud-managed networking, resolving licensing, device registration, and procurement challenges.
	? IoT & Smart Energy Enablement – Qolcom designed the secure onboarding process for Keele’s Smart Energy Network Demonstrator (SEND) and hydrogen energy trials.
	? Long-Term Support & Optimization – Unlike one-time deployments, we provide ongoing advisory services to ensure Keele’s network remains agile, scalable, and high-performing.

	 

	 

	Executive Summary: Enabling Keele’s Smart Campus Future

	 

	Keele University is on a mission to create one of the most sustainable and digitally advanced campuses in the world. Through its partnership with Qolcom and HPE Aruba Networking, Keele has established a resilient, cloud-managed network that enables seamless connectivity, smart campus innovation, and research-driven sustainability initiatives.

	 

	Key Outcomes

	?? Seamless Wi-Fi & Secure Connectivity – Over 2,000 Wi-Fi 6 access points provide uninterrupted campus-wide connectivity.
	?? Smart Energy & IoT Deployment – A scalable, AI-driven network powers real-time environmental monitoring, energy optimization, and research.
	?? Cloud-Managed Network Evolution – Qolcom guided Keele’s Aruba Central adoption and AOS10 migration, ensuring efficiency, automation, and long-term cost savings.
	?? Future-Proofed IT Strategy – Keele is now positioned as a leader in higher education digital transformation, with a network designed to adapt and scale for future growth.

	 

	With Qolcom’s expertise in strategy, security, and long-term lifecycle management, Keele’s smart campus vision is not just a concept—it’s a living, evolving reality. 

	 

	Let me know what you think.

	 

	Ta,

Hi Ajay,


Thank you again for yesterday.  Great to better understand the Bechtle proposition.

 

I’ve followed up with the team today and I know the guys are very interested in seeing the Bechtle Direct portal, understand how it can be customised as well as having a deep dive in to the pillars.  I’ll follow up with you to work out a few dates where we may be able to organise some additional sessions.

 

Have a good weekend all!

Subject:	RE: Keele Case Study – A Couple of Thoughts

I cant go back with all that mate………..

 

From: David Dunlop <ddunlop@qolcom.co.uk> 
Sent: 17 February 2025 15:53
To: Keith Reading <kreading@qolcom.co.uk>
Subject: RE: Keele Case Study – A Couple of Thoughts

 

Keith,

 

The case study looks good. Qolcom’s role comes through a lot more, and it ties in well with Keele’s long-term vision. A couple of things that I thought of:

 

*	Why Qolcom? In terms of showing our contribution, its much better, but there’s still quite a bit of focus on Aruba’s solutions. What about a short section explicitly highlighting what sets Qolcom apart, our strategic input, security expertise, and long-term support, could help highlight our value better?

 

*	Making it more accessible – I’m not sure about this one but I do always try and think about who was reading it and what level they are, because some of the more technical sections (AOS10 migration, ClearPass security) might be a bit heavy for non-technical readers. Maybe a short executive summary at the start could help frame the key takeaways in a way that resonates with a broader audience.

 

A brief idea of what I meant below . . .

Why Qolcom? A Strategic Partner in Smart Campus Transformation

While cutting-edge technology is critical to Keele University’s smart campus vision, the true value lies in the expertise and strategic guidance behind its deployment. Qolcom goes beyond simply implementing Aruba solutions—we ensure that the network is optimized, secure, and future-proofed for Keele’s evolving needs.

Unlike traditional resellers, Qolcom is a trusted technology partner with deep expertise in higher education digital transformation, network security, and cloud-managed networking. Our hands-on approach, from design consultation to ongoing lifecycle management, allows Keele to maximize its investment and continuously innovate.

 

What Sets Qolcom Apart?

 

? Consultative Approach – We worked closely with Keele’s IT team to align Aruba technology with their broader sustainability and smart campus roadmap.
? Security & Compliance Expertise – Our engineers ensured a robust, role-based access framework using ClearPass, securing thousands of student and IoT connections.
? Aruba Central & AOS10 Migration Leadership – We advised Keele on their transition to cloud-managed networking, resolving licensing, device registration, and procurement challenges.
? IoT & Smart Energy Enablement – Qolcom designed the secure onboarding process for Keele’s Smart Energy Network Demonstrator (SEND) and hydrogen energy trials.
? Long-Term Support & Optimization – Unlike one-time deployments, we provide ongoing advisory services to ensure Keele’s network remains agile, scalable, and high-performing.

 

 

Executive Summary: Enabling Keele’s Smart Campus Future

 

Keele University is on a mission to create one of the most sustainable and digitally advanced campuses in the world. Through its partnership with Qolcom and HPE Aruba Networking, Keele has established a resilient, cloud-managed network that enables seamless connectivity, smart campus innovation, and research-driven sustainability initiatives.

 

Key Outcomes

?? Seamless Wi-Fi & Secure Connectivity – Over 2,000 Wi-Fi 6 access points provide uninterrupted campus-wide connectivity.
?? Smart Energy & IoT Deployment – A scalable, AI-driven network powers real-time environmental monitoring, energy optimization, and research.
?? Cloud-Managed Network Evolution – Qolcom guided Keele’s Aruba Central adoption and AOS10 migration, ensuring efficiency, automation, and long-term cost savings.
?? Future-Proofed IT Strategy – Keele is now positioned as a leader in higher education digital transformation, with a network designed to adapt and scale for future growth.

Seems like this one is not relevant right now, so I’ll stop following up. Is there anyone else at Qolcom that he might be worth introducing to?

		Good afternoon David,  
		
		We help IT Services SME businesses hire top IT Sales & Technical talent within 21 days, leveraging 15 years of expertise to find candidates who drive growth. Would this be something that could be relevant to you or maybe another team member at Qolcom?
		
		Specifically, I am reaching out about a Business Development and Account Management professional with over a decade of experience delivering top-tier B2B technical solutions. Lewis has continually exceeded sales targets, achieving outstanding performances including closing £1M against a £500K target in 2023 and securing £400K in just two quarters of 2024. He has demonstrated a proven ability to grow new business revenue, contributing up to 70% of annual results in recent years.
		
		
		Would it be useful if I shared a short video to explain this?

Mat at Keele is chasing for this one to swap out his APs . . . the quote number is NQ08264894 for the replacement Aps. Can you please see what we can do here? I assume once I have the quote back I will calculate how many he can get or is that something you have to do Stel?

Hi Stel,  

 

Hope you’re doing well! I’ve got a quick one for you regarding a customer query. Keele University has 12 AP585s (serials below) that are still boxed and unopened, and they’re asking if it’s possible to swap these for AP587s. Could you let me know:  

 

I appreciate they will be different values and possibly a restocking fee, but in principle are you able to help out? ?? 

 

Here are the serials:  

CNQGL1M02V  

CNQGL1M06H  

CNPSL1M01T  

CNQGL1M03Y  

CNQGL1M04D  

CNQGL1M06G  

CNQGL1M00G  

CNQGL1M06F  

CNQGL1M035  

CNQGL1M06L  

CNPSL1M01B  

CNQGL1M055  

 

Let me know if there is anything else that you needed from me.

 

Cheers,

Hi David
Can you check with your contact at St Helens that this email is valid and relates to a proper PO?  The email send address looks odd and I don't want to open the PDF without confirmation.

Hello David,




Thank you for reaching out to OpenAI Support using the verified email address.




We understand how important it is to choose the right plan that best fits your needs, and we’re sorry that ChatGPT Pro did not provide the additional benefits you were expecting compared to your ChatGPT Team subscription. We appreciate your request for a cancellation and refund, and we’d be happy to process this for you.




We’ve gone ahead and processed a full refund in the amount of $240 for your subscription, including any tax. Additionally, your subscription has been canceled immediately to prevent any future charges. You should see the refund in your account within the next 10 days.




We hope this helps. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.




Best,
?Ayen

Mat, Kate,

 

Will do . . . also, to keep you both in the loop I have chased up the AP swap out. I suspect it is very achievable, but the process is possibly a pain at the back end, so possibly why its taking a it of time. Nonetheless I will get back to you as soon as I know anything.

 

Thanks,

Hi David, 

 

Could we get this quote changed please to be:

 

6 x AP-270-MNT-H3

1 x AP-270-MNT-H1

 

And if you can make sure Kate is copied in, we can get it raised next week.

 

Many thanks,

Mat

Hi David, 

 

We have 12 AP585's remaining that we would like to swap for AP587. Could you let us know how many AP587s we could get by returning these please?

 

These are the serial numbers:

CNQGL1M02V

CNQGL1M06H

CNPSL1M01T

CNQGL1M03Y

CNQGL1M04D

CNQGL1M06G

CNQGL1M00G

CNQGL1M06F

CNQGL1M035

CNQGL1M06L

CNPSL1M01B

CNQGL1M055

 

They are all still boxed and haven't been undone.

 

We are also looking for a couple of extra AP-270-MNT-H1 mounts. Could we get a price for these please?

 

Thanks,

Mat

David,

Thanks for the quick turn around on the quote, as you will be aware we are going through some very stringent financial decisions at the moment so i've got some follow up questions re. the figures that i'm hoping you can answer.


1.	Is this a perpetual licence rather than an annual charge?
2.	
	Do we have some sense of how long “perpetual” lasts? If it’s for the current controller / ClearPass version then do we have any idea how long it would be before we’d need to incur the costs again.
3.	
	Is there any recurrent maintenance charge that increases if we add these licences?
4.	
	Could we add the licenses in two batches at the same price, one this financial year (20%) and the remainder next financial year (80%)?

Hi David, Heidi,

 

AP-635’s are reserved, unfortunately none of the AP-565’s are in, so can’t even nick one for you, you are top of the list when they land, hopefully be in early around 20th. Would you like us to part ship so they have the other APs?

Stel,

 

I’m hoping you can help me? This is the one I spoke to you about on teams, where Durham are in need of an additional 13 x AP-635s and 1 x AP-565. I’m forwarding the email chain below regarding Durham University’s order for additional APs (QUO-17256). As you can see, there is significant urgency around this delivery, with key stakeholders emphasising the need to receive the APs as soon as possible to prevent installation delays. 

 

Currently, the estimated delivery date is February 26th, but if there’s anything that can be done to accelerate this it would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if there’s any way to improve the delivery timeline, or if there are any alternative options we could explore. 

 

Thanks mate,

I have updated Aceda, and suggested/agreed for them to get the cables in place so it’s just a case of fastening the AP’s to the ceiling as soon as they arrive

 

Unfortunately, as these are a fairly new model AP, we don’t have many spares, the ones we do have, have been used at Boldon already, I will keep you updated

 

Regards

Stel,

 

I’m hoping you can help me? This is the one I spoke to you about on teams, where Durham are in need of an additional 13 x AP-635s and 1 x AP-565. I’m forwarding the email chain below regarding Durham University’s order for additional APs (QUO-17256). As you can see, there is significant urgency around this delivery, with key stakeholders emphasising the need to receive the APs as soon as possible to prevent installation delays. 

 

Currently, the estimated delivery date is February 26th, but if there’s anything that can be done to accelerate this it would be greatly appreciated. Please let me know if there’s any way to improve the delivery timeline, or if there are any alternative options we could explore. 

 

Thanks mate,

Morning Yvonne,

 

I have been talking to Qolcom since the order went in to advise on the urgency of this order, at present I have a delivery date of February 26th at the latest, but they are trying to get them from a different customers order to speed up the process

 

I have updated Aceda, and suggested/agreed for them to get the cables in place so it’s just a case of fastening the AP’s to the ceiling as soon as they arrive

 

Unfortunately, as these are a fairly new model AP, we don’t have many spares, the ones we do have, have been used at Boldon already, I will keep you updated

 

Regards

Glen,

 

I have put together indicative pricing for you just now, but as you will see I have quoted 75k instead of 68k due to that being cheaper, however we can look at various combinations of the licenses to get a balance of the amount you actually need and value. They come in 1k, 5k, 10k, 25k, 50k and 100k.

Can you provide a quote for 68k access licences for CP. 

 

We are trying to understand the cost element of implement NAC across our estate, is there any chance we can get this back CoP Friday 14th Feb even if it is an indicative price.

	I am reaching out to request the cancellation and a refund for my ChatGPT o1 Pro subscription, which I purchased last week.

	I used ChatGPT to determine what was available to upgrade to and it recommended o1 Pro but it now turns out that the ChatGPT Team account I have is better and more features, so upon further review, I have realized that ChatGPT o1 Pro provides fewer features than my existing ChatGPT Team subscription, including potential limitations on file uploads and advanced tools. Initially, I was under the impression that ChatGPT o1 Pro would be an upgrade, but I now understand that it does not provide additional benefits compared to what I already have.

	Given that I have only had the subscription for a short time and have not found it to meet my needs, I would appreciate a refund in accordance with OpenAI’s policies.

	Please let me know the next steps for processing this request. I appreciate your time and assistance.

Good afternoon and I hope you are well. 

 

Following on from the interchanges between yourself and Blyott, please see the attached. 

 

Gery has confirmed that even though his quotation is offering the T2 tags, he will happily supply whichever tags are needed (as per the below, youd suggest: T2, tiny tags and possibly sticker tags). 

 

Everything has been quoted against three months so, if you would need the costs for 12 months, its simple multiplication based on subscription costs, webhooks and Rest APIs

 

If you should need anything else or, should have any further questions – please give me a call or drop me a mail.

Hi Lars/Gery,

 

Apologies for the delay in our response. 

 

I think initially it would be ideal to understand the full costs for 1 year and then make a case for the pilot from there. 

 

Number of APs: 1000 access points running Aruba AOS10.7.x from Central

Number of Tags for keyrings: 50 for Pilot (100 in final solution)

Number of Tags for medical assets (manequins) : 20 for Pilot (200 in final solution)

Number of stickers for Library Books: 20 for Pilot (100+ in Final Solution)

 

Please let me know if you have any more questions about this opportunity. 

 

Thanks,


Stuart.

Hi Lars,

 

Yes, It’s an Aruba infrastructure, with the customer halfway through a migration from AOS8 to AOS10 cloud managed, so will have to work with that. 

 

We need to put a proposal together for a Pilot for the Keys, Medical Assets and Library books with as minimal cost as possible, but understand it will cost something, so a quote from you guys would be great. 

 

Nick is fine, always busy and I am sure he is talking about Blyott to all of his NHS and Logistics customers. 

 

Thanks,


Stuart.

Hi Stuart,

 

Sounds promising, any idea about numbers/budget – WIFI infrastructure I assume ARUBA?

 

What do you expect from us to make this happen? Can we quote something?

 

BTW – how is Nick doing, been a while since I heard from our talkative friend.. ??

Subject: RE: Keele University - Key Fobs

Hi Lars,

 

Following a call with the customer today we have some more detail on the size of the pilot and some very interesting additional use cases that we can include:

 

The pilot does not need to include student accommodation, just the main campus buildings, which will total approx. 1,000 access points. 

 

Estates Keys

 

The Prime Use case is the tracking of high value keys or sets of keys that get loaned out. 

 

Secondary use cases include:

 

Medical School

 

The University has a medical school (Darwin Building) which has some very high value assets that need to be tracked. For the pilot they will focus on 4 mannequins that are used for teaching. Each mannequin has an associated box of technology paired with it, both mannequin and the box need to be tagged and appropriate workflows be configured. 

 

There is additional kit that will need to be tracked if the pilot is successful including kit that goes into an Ambulance that they use. 

 

The University has a close relationship with Royal Stoke Hospital so this could be a great opportunity to demonstrate Blyott to the NHS. 

 

Library Books

 

There is a requirement to track high value library books that are not allowed to be checked out of the library , but get purposefully misplaced by students. The pilot will need to determine of the system has enough granularity for making this a success

 

As you can see there is some really good opportunity to demonstrate to the University how a campus wide asset tracking solution can be used to solved all sorts of problems. 

 

What are your thoughts?

 

Thanks,


Stuart.

Hi Stuart,

 

We’d like to participate in this, but I think we to insist to broaden the scope of the initial pilot, otherwise we will gain no value in setting this up, I’m sure if they have 2k AP they have a lot of valuable assets that might be interesting to provide with a tag across campus.. ??

Hi Lars,

 

Based on a conversation with Keele University Estates team at the end of last year, they would very much like to understand the costs to run a pilot for tracking sets of keys around the campus. Bear in mind this is an initial use case and if successful will lead to other uses. 

 

Can we please have some indicative costs for a pilot deployment for the following:

 

*	50 Blyott Tags (Suitable to be attached to a set of keys – BT-T2?). 
*	Integration with a large portion of the Campus, if not all of it, to make the pilot successful. The site has a total of approx. 2,000 access points
*	Blyott Platform access for pilot period

 

Note: There will be no Asset register integration required as the University do not currently record the Keys in an asset registry other than a databased, so we can add all Asset information manually. 

 

If you have any further questions about this then do not hesitate to contact David or Myself. 

 

Best Regards,


Stuart.

Simon,

 

Moved the test laptop 192.168.99.13 to Cisco switch port vlan set.

 

Started pinging the other laptop 192.168.99.10 straight away .

 

I’ve pinged 10.2.1.2 and got a reply.

 

Anything else need me to do?

I have shut down a number of links and removed the route-maps from the redistribution but no change in result as of yet... I have not issued any "wr mem" so you can just reboot them if thats easier...

 

Basically, I have isolated CC from COLo, CL and NU-WAN.

 

Thanks,

Sion

Hi Simon,

The Cisco isn’t manageable – only via console.

 

I’m not convinced we’ve got the lab in a good place for checking now I’ve had another look at it, I don’t want to waste your time so leave it with me until I’m convinced the lab is reset the way it needs to be – just  I’m in the middle of other changes too at the minute.

 

Thanks Simon,

David

Is the Cisco switch CLI accessible via the VPN? If so, can you please let me know the IP address and add my credentials to the switch so I can login?

Cisco Switch:
VLAN 200 SVI: 192.168.99.254

VLAN 951 SVI: 192.168.52.250/30

 

FYI the following behaviour was observed last week

 

PING

From: Cisco SVI 200 [192.168.99.254]

To: Colo fabric vrf campus loopback 2 [10.2.1.5/32]

SUCCESS!

 

But flipped the other way round the ping failed.

 

Thanks,David

Hi Simon, 

 

Please can I chase a response for David , as I have mentioned before we do need to keep the momentum going on this project. 

 

I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it. We need to have the confidence that the multi fabric solution is going to work in our environment. 

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Subject: Multifabric Lab - weird reachability issue

 

Hi Simon,

 

We’ve run into an issue in the lab environment.

 

Len suggested we extend the lab, in order to include a Cisco device that was hosting an SVI as a gateway for Layer 2 spanned networks. We had done this successfully already in the off-campus environment, but not with the multi-fabric setup.

 

I’ll briefly explain but perhaps a call might help if that is possible? 

 

So, we have a Cisco switch connected to CC-BL . The Cisco switch hosts an SVI (VLAN 200 in the lab) and also an OSPF adjacency with CC-BL (using VLAN 951). What we have noticed is:

*	All VTEP devices see all consistent information in:

	*	Vrf campus RIB
	*	BGP L2VPN EVPN

*	Only CC-BL and CL-BL can source a ping from their VRF campus loopbacks and local SVIs and reach the SVI hosted on Cisco (VLAN 200) – all other VTEPs cannot do this
*	The Cisco VLAN 200 SVI is fully reachable via VLAN 200 clients in the fabric no matter which VTEP they are connected to.
*	VLAN 200 clients in the fabric can actually ping SVIs and loopbacks in the fabric (e.g. Colo loopback in vrf campus) suggesting we are routing via the Cisco into the fabric ok, however the reverse ping is not functional

 

I’m drawing a bit of a blank on it at the moment and will need to dismantle the lab shortly for equipment redeploy – no doubt we will seek to come back to this after we do get the kit redeployed but thought it might be of interest to you before we down the lab as it might take a few weeks to reinstate this scenario after next week.

 

Many thanks,

Hi Heidi,

 

This is in relation to the Aberdeen Uni quote we spoke about last week. To hopefully make this easier, I’ve separated from the original quote and created a new opportunity. Hopefully that should make the admin easier when the ‘kit’ PO comes in shortly. I had believed it was going to be ordered in its entirety.

Hi Lars/Gery,

 

Apologies for the delay in our response. 

 

I think initially it would be ideal to understand the full costs for 1 year and then make a case for the pilot from there. 

 

Number of APs: 1000 access points running Aruba AOS10.7.x from Central

Number of Tags for keyrings: 50 for Pilot (100 in final solution)

Number of Tags for medical assets (manequins) : 20 for Pilot (200 in final solution)

Number of stickers for Library Books: 20 for Pilot (100+ in Final Solution)

 

Please let me know if you have any more questions about this opportunity. 

 

Thanks,


Stuart.

Hi Lars,

 

Yes, It’s an Aruba infrastructure, with the customer halfway through a migration from AOS8 to AOS10 cloud managed, so will have to work with that. 

 

We need to put a proposal together for a Pilot for the Keys, Medical Assets and Library books with as minimal cost as possible, but understand it will cost something, so a quote from you guys would be great. 

 

Nick is fine, always busy and I am sure he is talking about Blyott to all of his NHS and Logistics customers.

Hi Lars,

 

Following a call with the customer today we have some more detail on the size of the pilot and some very interesting additional use cases that we can include:

 

The pilot does not need to include student accommodation, just the main campus buildings, which will total approx. 1,000 access points. 

 

Estates Keys

 

The Prime Use case is the tracking of high value keys or sets of keys that get loaned out. 

 

Secondary use cases include:

 

Medical School

 

The University has a medical school (Darwin Building) which has some very high value assets that need to be tracked. For the pilot they will focus on 4 mannequins that are used for teaching. Each mannequin has an associated box of technology paired with it, both mannequin and the box need to be tagged and appropriate workflows be configured. 

 

There is additional kit that will need to be tracked if the pilot is successful including kit that goes into an Ambulance that they use. 

 

The University has a close relationship with Royal Stoke Hospital so this could be a great opportunity to demonstrate Blyott to the NHS. 

 

Library Books

 

There is a requirement to track high value library books that are not allowed to be checked out of the library , but get purposefully misplaced by students. The pilot will need to determine of the system has enough granularity for making this a success

 

As you can see there is some really good opportunity to demonstrate to the University how a campus wide asset tracking solution can be used to solved all sorts of problems. 

 

What are your thoughts?

 

Thanks,


Stuart.

Hi Stuart,

 

We’d like to participate in this, but I think we to insist to broaden the scope of the initial pilot, otherwise we will gain no value in setting this up, I’m sure if they have 2k AP they have a lot of valuable assets that might be interesting to provide with a tag across campus.. ??

Subject: Keele University - Key Fobs

Hi Lars,

 

Based on a conversation with Keele University Estates team at the end of last year, they would very much like to understand the costs to run a pilot for tracking sets of keys around the campus. Bear in mind this is an initial use case and if successful will lead to other uses. 

 

Can we please have some indicative costs for a pilot deployment for the following:

 

*	50 Blyott Tags (Suitable to be attached to a set of keys – BT-T2?). 
*	Integration with a large portion of the Campus, if not all of it, to make the pilot successful. The site has a total of approx. 2,000 access points
*	Blyott Platform access for pilot period

 

Note: There will be no Asset register integration required as the University do not currently record the Keys in an asset registry other than a databased, so we can add all Asset information manually. 

 

If you have any further questions about this then do not hesitate to contact David or Myself. 

 

Best Regards,


Stuart. 

Stuart Pass

I have shut down a number of links and removed the route-maps from the redistribution but no change in result as of yet... I have not issued any "wr mem" so you can just reboot them if thats easier...

 

Basically, I have isolated CC from COLo, CL and NU-WAN.

Hi Simon,

The Cisco isn’t manageable – only via console.

 

I’m not convinced we’ve got the lab in a good place for checking now I’ve had another look at it, I don’t want to waste your time so leave it with me until I’m convinced the lab is reset the way it needs to be – just  I’m in the middle of other changes too at the minute.

 

Thanks Simon,

David

Hi David,

 

What is the IP address of the VLAN 200 SVI on the Cisco switch attached via VLAN 951?

 

Thanks,

Simon

Hi Simon, 

 

Please can I chase a response for David , as I have mentioned before we do need to keep the momentum going on this project. 

 

I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it. We need to have the confidence that the multi fabric solution is going to work in our environment. 

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Subject: Multifabric Lab - weird reachability issue

 

Hi Simon,

 

We’ve run into an issue in the lab environment.

 

Len suggested we extend the lab, in order to include a Cisco device that was hosting an SVI as a gateway for Layer 2 spanned networks. We had done this successfully already in the off-campus environment, but not with the multi-fabric setup.

 

I’ll briefly explain but perhaps a call might help if that is possible? 

 

So, we have a Cisco switch connected to CC-BL . The Cisco switch hosts an SVI (VLAN 200 in the lab) and also an OSPF adjacency with CC-BL (using VLAN 951). What we have noticed is:

*	All VTEP devices see all consistent information in:

	*	Vrf campus RIB
	*	BGP L2VPN EVPN

*	Only CC-BL and CL-BL can source a ping from their VRF campus loopbacks and local SVIs and reach the SVI hosted on Cisco (VLAN 200) – all other VTEPs cannot do this
*	The Cisco VLAN 200 SVI is fully reachable via VLAN 200 clients in the fabric no matter which VTEP they are connected to.
*	VLAN 200 clients in the fabric can actually ping SVIs and loopbacks in the fabric (e.g. Colo loopback in vrf campus) suggesting we are routing via the Cisco into the fabric ok, however the reverse ping is not functional

 

I’m drawing a bit of a blank on it at the moment and will need to dismantle the lab shortly for equipment redeploy – no doubt we will seek to come back to this after we do get the kit redeployed but thought it might be of interest to you before we down the lab as it might take a few weeks to reinstate this scenario after next week.

 

Many thanks,

Hi David,

Please can you connect a client to an access port in VLAN 99 on the Cisco switch and give it an IP Address in that range and set to the DG to the SVI Address. Please make sure the firewall is off.

Even stripping this back to a single fabric by isolating CL and COLO has not made any difference...

Thanks,

Simon

Oh – I noticed the routes were off on the Cisco and I checked lab and saw I had interfaces down etc – so I’ve no doubt impacted your testing – sorry!

I have shut down a number of links and removed the route-maps from the redistribution but no change in result as of yet... I have not issued any "wr mem" so you can just reboot them if thats easier...

 

Basically, I have isolated CC from COLo, CL and NU-WAN.

Hi Simon,

The Cisco isn’t manageable – only via console.

 

I’m not convinced we’ve got the lab in a good place for checking now I’ve had another look at it, I don’t want to waste your time so leave it with me until I’m convinced the lab is reset the way it needs to be – just  I’m in the middle of other changes too at the minute.

 

Thanks Simon,

Cisco Switch:
VLAN 200 SVI: 192.168.99.254

VLAN 951 SVI: 192.168.52.250/30

 

FYI the following behaviour was observed last week

 

PING

From: Cisco SVI 200 [192.168.99.254]

To: Colo fabric vrf campus loopback 2 [10.2.1.5/32]

SUCCESS!

 

But flipped the other way round the ping failed.

Hi Simon, 

 

Please can I chase a response for David , as I have mentioned before we do need to keep the momentum going on this project. 

 

I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it. We need to have the confidence that the multi fabric solution is going to work in our environment. 

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Subject: Multifabric Lab - weird reachability issue

 

Hi Simon,

 

We’ve run into an issue in the lab environment.

 

Len suggested we extend the lab, in order to include a Cisco device that was hosting an SVI as a gateway for Layer 2 spanned networks. We had done this successfully already in the off-campus environment, but not with the multi-fabric setup.

 

I’ll briefly explain but perhaps a call might help if that is possible? 

 

So, we have a Cisco switch connected to CC-BL . The Cisco switch hosts an SVI (VLAN 200 in the lab) and also an OSPF adjacency with CC-BL (using VLAN 951). What we have noticed is:

*	All VTEP devices see all consistent information in:

	*	Vrf campus RIB
	*	BGP L2VPN EVPN

*	Only CC-BL and CL-BL can source a ping from their VRF campus loopbacks and local SVIs and reach the SVI hosted on Cisco (VLAN 200) – all other VTEPs cannot do this
*	The Cisco VLAN 200 SVI is fully reachable via VLAN 200 clients in the fabric no matter which VTEP they are connected to.
*	VLAN 200 clients in the fabric can actually ping SVIs and loopbacks in the fabric (e.g. Colo loopback in vrf campus) suggesting we are routing via the Cisco into the fabric ok, however the reverse ping is not functional

 

I’m drawing a bit of a blank on it at the moment and will need to dismantle the lab shortly for equipment redeploy – no doubt we will seek to come back to this after we do get the kit redeployed but thought it might be of interest to you before we down the lab as it might take a few weeks to reinstate this scenario after next week.

 

Many thanks,

Hi David

In short, no.  We cannot provide a false credit service to a customer and we cannot accept a PO against a valid quote and then deliver something completely different.  In real terms, this will be 100% against Aberdeen Uni policy and ours.  

Imagine if he asked for us to deliver a TV instead that he then kept?  It’s a form of fraud.

Regarding the current ‘open’ PO (via EE) that Euan organised for them – I suggest we close that down and say no further invoices will be raised.

Heidi,

 

Alan Skinner at Aberdeen is back on at me and suggesting I misunderstood his request. I replied saying we couldn’t do anything as it had already been invoiced. 

 

His idea is:

*	I send him a new quote for the same switch.
*	He raises a PO against it, but we don’t provision the switch.
*	Instead, we just adjust the credit balance so he can use it on a future order.

 

Before I go back to him, just need to check if this is something we can do and make sure it doesn’t cause any issues for us at our end.

 

Cheers,

I have shut down a number of links and removed the route-maps from the redistribution but no change in result as of yet... I have not issued any "wr mem" so you can just reboot them if thats easier...

 

Basically, I have isolated CC from COLo, CL and NU-WAN.

 

Thanks,

Sion

Hi Simon,

The Cisco isn’t manageable – only via console.

 

I’m not convinced we’ve got the lab in a good place for checking now I’ve had another look at it, I don’t want to waste your time so leave it with me until I’m convinced the lab is reset the way it needs to be – just  I’m in the middle of other changes too at the minute.

 

Thanks Simon,

David

Is the Cisco switch CLI accessible via the VPN? If so, can you please let me know the IP address and add my credentials to the switch so I can login?

 

Thanks,

Cisco Switch:
VLAN 200 SVI: 192.168.99.254

VLAN 951 SVI: 192.168.52.250/30

 

FYI the following behaviour was observed last week

 

PING

From: Cisco SVI 200 [192.168.99.254]

To: Colo fabric vrf campus loopback 2 [10.2.1.5/32]

SUCCESS!

 

But flipped the other way round the ping failed.

 

Thanks,David

Hi David,

 

What is the IP address of the VLAN 200 SVI on the Cisco switch attached via VLAN 951?

 

Thanks,

Hi Simon, 

 

Please can I chase a response for David , as I have mentioned before we do need to keep the momentum going on this project. 

 

I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it. We need to have the confidence that the multi fabric solution is going to work in our environment. 

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Subject: Multifabric Lab - weird reachability issue

 

Hi Simon,

 

We’ve run into an issue in the lab environment.

 

Len suggested we extend the lab, in order to include a Cisco device that was hosting an SVI as a gateway for Layer 2 spanned networks. We had done this successfully already in the off-campus environment, but not with the multi-fabric setup.

 

I’ll briefly explain but perhaps a call might help if that is possible? 

 

So, we have a Cisco switch connected to CC-BL . The Cisco switch hosts an SVI (VLAN 200 in the lab) and also an OSPF adjacency with CC-BL (using VLAN 951). What we have noticed is:

*	All VTEP devices see all consistent information in:

	*	Vrf campus RIB
	*	BGP L2VPN EVPN

*	Only CC-BL and CL-BL can source a ping from their VRF campus loopbacks and local SVIs and reach the SVI hosted on Cisco (VLAN 200) – all other VTEPs cannot do this
*	The Cisco VLAN 200 SVI is fully reachable via VLAN 200 clients in the fabric no matter which VTEP they are connected to.
*	VLAN 200 clients in the fabric can actually ping SVIs and loopbacks in the fabric (e.g. Colo loopback in vrf campus) suggesting we are routing via the Cisco into the fabric ok, however the reverse ping is not functional

 

I’m drawing a bit of a blank on it at the moment and will need to dismantle the lab shortly for equipment redeploy – no doubt we will seek to come back to this after we do get the kit redeployed but thought it might be of interest to you before we down the lab as it might take a few weeks to reinstate this scenario after next week.

 

Many thanks,

Subject: RE: Introducing Bechtle World & BSST into Qolcom

 

Hi Ajay,


Thank you again for yesterday.  Great to better understand the Bechtle proposition. 

 

I’ve followed up with the team today and I know the guys are very interested in seeing the Bechtle Direct portal, understand how it can be customised as well as having a deep dive in to the pillars.  I’ll follow up with you to work out a few dates where we may be able to organise some additional sessions.

 

Have a good weekend all!  

 

Ben

Hello gents,


This is the invite for the Juniper sales enablement.  It’s part 1 of a 3 part series.  My understanding is it was more of a consultative engagement around FE and School’s, however the invite states Public Sector.  

 

Feel free to accept and join remotely or in person.  Just drop me an IM if you plan to go to Chippenham so I can let the guys know.


Cheers

 

Ben

The training is designed specifically for Public Sector, to boost your 'consultative selling' skills.

 

This will be run both on site in Chippenham and remotely .. This is a placeholder for now, more information will be sent out closer to the time.

 

Many thanks in advance for your support.

Oh – I noticed the routes were off on the Cisco and I checked lab and saw I had interfaces down etc – so I’ve no doubt impacted your testing – sorry!

 

I will leave it alone if you’re happy to continue?

I have shut down a number of links and removed the route-maps from the redistribution but no change in result as of yet... I have not issued any "wr mem" so you can just reboot them if thats easier...

 

Basically, I have isolated CC from COLo, CL and NU-WAN.

 

Thanks,

Sion

Hi Simon,

The Cisco isn’t manageable – only via console.

 

I’m not convinced we’ve got the lab in a good place for checking now I’ve had another look at it, I don’t want to waste your time so leave it with me until I’m convinced the lab is reset the way it needs to be – just  I’m in the middle of other changes too at the minute.

 

Thanks Simon,

David

Is the Cisco switch CLI accessible via the VPN? If so, can you please let me know the IP address and add my credentials to the switch so I can login?

Cisco Switch:
VLAN 200 SVI: 192.168.99.254

VLAN 951 SVI: 192.168.52.250/30

 

FYI the following behaviour was observed last week

 

PING

From: Cisco SVI 200 [192.168.99.254]

To: Colo fabric vrf campus loopback 2 [10.2.1.5/32]

SUCCESS!

 

But flipped the other way round the ping failed.

 

Thanks,David

Please can I chase a response for David , as I have mentioned before we do need to keep the momentum going on this project. 

 

I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it. We need to have the confidence that the multi fabric solution is going to work in our environment. 

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Subject: Multifabric Lab - weird reachability issue

 

Hi Simon,

 

We’ve run into an issue in the lab environment.

 

Len suggested we extend the lab, in order to include a Cisco device that was hosting an SVI as a gateway for Layer 2 spanned networks. We had done this successfully already in the off-campus environment, but not with the multi-fabric setup.

 

I’ll briefly explain but perhaps a call might help if that is possible? 

 

So, we have a Cisco switch connected to CC-BL . The Cisco switch hosts an SVI (VLAN 200 in the lab) and also an OSPF adjacency with CC-BL (using VLAN 951). What we have noticed is:

*	All VTEP devices see all consistent information in:

	*	Vrf campus RIB
	*	BGP L2VPN EVPN

*	Only CC-BL and CL-BL can source a ping from their VRF campus loopbacks and local SVIs and reach the SVI hosted on Cisco (VLAN 200) – all other VTEPs cannot do this
*	The Cisco VLAN 200 SVI is fully reachable via VLAN 200 clients in the fabric no matter which VTEP they are connected to.
*	VLAN 200 clients in the fabric can actually ping SVIs and loopbacks in the fabric (e.g. Colo loopback in vrf campus) suggesting we are routing via the Cisco into the fabric ok, however the reverse ping is not functional

 

I’m drawing a bit of a blank on it at the moment and will need to dismantle the lab shortly for equipment redeploy – no doubt we will seek to come back to this after we do get the kit redeployed but thought it might be of interest to you before we down the lab as it might take a few weeks to reinstate this scenario after next week.

Sure. Thanks.

I am just trying to simplify the setup as much as possible... At every layer of the fabric within the campus VRF i can see routes to the Cisco switch, though only get a response from the CC-BL to the VLAN 200 network. From the CoLo and CC-DL I could ping the cisco end of the VLAN 951 link but not VLAN 200 behind it... Even though there is a route! Wierd!

Oh – I noticed the routes were off on the Cisco and I checked lab and saw I had interfaces down etc – so I’ve no doubt impacted your testing – sorry!

 

I will leave it alone if you’re happy to continue?

I have shut down a number of links and removed the route-maps from the redistribution but no change in result as of yet... I have not issued any "wr mem" so you can just reboot them if thats easier...

 

Basically, I have isolated CC from COLo, CL and NU-WAN.

 

Thanks,

Sion

Hi Simon,

The Cisco isn’t manageable – only via console.

 

I’m not convinced we’ve got the lab in a good place for checking now I’ve had another look at it, I don’t want to waste your time so leave it with me until I’m convinced the lab is reset the way it needs to be – just  I’m in the middle of other changes too at the minute.

 

Thanks Simon,

David

Is the Cisco switch CLI accessible via the VPN? If so, can you please let me know the IP address and add my credentials to the switch so I can login?

 

Thanks,

Simon

Cisco Switch:
VLAN 200 SVI: 192.168.99.254

VLAN 951 SVI: 192.168.52.250/30

 

FYI the following behaviour was observed last week

 

PING

From: Cisco SVI 200 [192.168.99.254]

To: Colo fabric vrf campus loopback 2 [10.2.1.5/32]

SUCCESS!

 

But flipped the other way round the ping failed.

 

Thanks,David

Oh – I noticed the routes were off on the Cisco and I checked lab and saw I had interfaces down etc – so I’ve no doubt impacted your testing – sorry!

 

I will leave it alone if you’re happy to continue?

I have shut down a number of links and removed the route-maps from the redistribution but no change in result as of yet... I have not issued any "wr mem" so you can just reboot them if thats easier...

 

Basically, I have isolated CC from COLo, CL and NU-WAN.

Hi Simon,

The Cisco isn’t manageable – only via console.

 

I’m not convinced we’ve got the lab in a good place for checking now I’ve had another look at it, I don’t want to waste your time so leave it with me until I’m convinced the lab is reset the way it needs to be – just  I’m in the middle of other changes too at the minute.

 

Thanks Simon,

David

Cisco Switch:
VLAN 200 SVI: 192.168.99.254

VLAN 951 SVI: 192.168.52.250/30

 

FYI the following behaviour was observed last week

 

PING

From: Cisco SVI 200 [192.168.99.254]

To: Colo fabric vrf campus loopback 2 [10.2.1.5/32]

SUCCESS!

 

But flipped the other way round the ping failed.

Hi Simon, 

 

Please can I chase a response for David , as I have mentioned before we do need to keep the momentum going on this project. 

 

I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it. We need to have the confidence that the multi fabric solution is going to work in our environment. 

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Subject: Multifabric Lab - weird reachability issue

 

Hi Simon,

 

We’ve run into an issue in the lab environment.

 

Len suggested we extend the lab, in order to include a Cisco device that was hosting an SVI as a gateway for Layer 2 spanned networks. We had done this successfully already in the off-campus environment, but not with the multi-fabric setup.

 

I’ll briefly explain but perhaps a call might help if that is possible? 

 

So, we have a Cisco switch connected to CC-BL . The Cisco switch hosts an SVI (VLAN 200 in the lab) and also an OSPF adjacency with CC-BL (using VLAN 951). What we have noticed is:

*	All VTEP devices see all consistent information in:

	*	Vrf campus RIB
	*	BGP L2VPN EVPN

*	Only CC-BL and CL-BL can source a ping from their VRF campus loopbacks and local SVIs and reach the SVI hosted on Cisco (VLAN 200) – all other VTEPs cannot do this
*	The Cisco VLAN 200 SVI is fully reachable via VLAN 200 clients in the fabric no matter which VTEP they are connected to.
*	VLAN 200 clients in the fabric can actually ping SVIs and loopbacks in the fabric (e.g. Colo loopback in vrf campus) suggesting we are routing via the Cisco into the fabric ok, however the reverse ping is not functional

 

I’m drawing a bit of a blank on it at the moment and will need to dismantle the lab shortly for equipment redeploy – no doubt we will seek to come back to this after we do get the kit redeployed but thought it might be of interest to you before we down the lab as it might take a few weeks to reinstate this scenario after next week.

 

Many thanks,

Hi Simon, 

 

Please can I chase a response for David , as I have mentioned before we do need to keep the momentum going on this project. 

 

I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it. We need to have the confidence that the multi fabric solution is going to work in our environment. 

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Subject: Multifabric Lab - weird reachability issue

 

Hi Simon,

 

We’ve run into an issue in the lab environment.

 

Len suggested we extend the lab, in order to include a Cisco device that was hosting an SVI as a gateway for Layer 2 spanned networks. We had done this successfully already in the off-campus environment, but not with the multi-fabric setup.

 

I’ll briefly explain but perhaps a call might help if that is possible? 

 

So, we have a Cisco switch connected to CC-BL . The Cisco switch hosts an SVI (VLAN 200 in the lab) and also an OSPF adjacency with CC-BL (using VLAN 951). What we have noticed is:

*	All VTEP devices see all consistent information in:

	*	Vrf campus RIB
	*	BGP L2VPN EVPN

*	Only CC-BL and CL-BL can source a ping from their VRF campus loopbacks and local SVIs and reach the SVI hosted on Cisco (VLAN 200) – all other VTEPs cannot do this
*	The Cisco VLAN 200 SVI is fully reachable via VLAN 200 clients in the fabric no matter which VTEP they are connected to.
*	VLAN 200 clients in the fabric can actually ping SVIs and loopbacks in the fabric (e.g. Colo loopback in vrf campus) suggesting we are routing via the Cisco into the fabric ok, however the reverse ping is not functional

 

I’m drawing a bit of a blank on it at the moment and will need to dismantle the lab shortly for equipment redeploy – no doubt we will seek to come back to this after we do get the kit redeployed but thought it might be of interest to you before we down the lab as it might take a few weeks to reinstate this scenario after next week.

 

Many thanks,

Hi Simon,

The Cisco isn’t manageable – only via console.

 

I’m not convinced we’ve got the lab in a good place for checking now I’ve had another look at it, I don’t want to waste your time so leave it with me until I’m convinced the lab is reset the way it needs to be – just  I’m in the middle of other changes too at the minute.

 

Thanks Simon,

David

Hi Simon, 

 

Please can I chase a response for David , as I have mentioned before we do need to keep the momentum going on this project. 

 

I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it. We need to have the confidence that the multi fabric solution is going to work in our environment. 

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Subject: Multifabric Lab - weird reachability issue

 

Hi Simon,

 

We’ve run into an issue in the lab environment.

 

Len suggested we extend the lab, in order to include a Cisco device that was hosting an SVI as a gateway for Layer 2 spanned networks. We had done this successfully already in the off-campus environment, but not with the multi-fabric setup.

 

I’ll briefly explain but perhaps a call might help if that is possible? 

 

So, we have a Cisco switch connected to CC-BL . The Cisco switch hosts an SVI (VLAN 200 in the lab) and also an OSPF adjacency with CC-BL (using VLAN 951). What we have noticed is:

*	All VTEP devices see all consistent information in:

	*	Vrf campus RIB
	*	BGP L2VPN EVPN

*	Only CC-BL and CL-BL can source a ping from their VRF campus loopbacks and local SVIs and reach the SVI hosted on Cisco (VLAN 200) – all other VTEPs cannot do this
*	The Cisco VLAN 200 SVI is fully reachable via VLAN 200 clients in the fabric no matter which VTEP they are connected to.
*	VLAN 200 clients in the fabric can actually ping SVIs and loopbacks in the fabric (e.g. Colo loopback in vrf campus) suggesting we are routing via the Cisco into the fabric ok, however the reverse ping is not functional

 

I’m drawing a bit of a blank on it at the moment and will need to dismantle the lab shortly for equipment redeploy – no doubt we will seek to come back to this after we do get the kit redeployed but thought it might be of interest to you before we down the lab as it might take a few weeks to reinstate this scenario after next week.

 

Many thanks,

Cisco Switch:
VLAN 200 SVI: 192.168.99.254

VLAN 951 SVI: 192.168.52.250/30

 

FYI the following behaviour was observed last week

 

PING

From: Cisco SVI 200 [192.168.99.254]

To: Colo fabric vrf campus loopback 2 [10.2.1.5/32]

SUCCESS!

 

But flipped the other way round the ping failed.

Hi Simon, 

 

Please can I chase a response for David , as I have mentioned before we do need to keep the momentum going on this project. 

 

I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it. We need to have the confidence that the multi fabric solution is going to work in our environment. 

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Subject: Multifabric Lab - weird reachability issue

 

Hi Simon,

 

We’ve run into an issue in the lab environment.

 

Len suggested we extend the lab, in order to include a Cisco device that was hosting an SVI as a gateway for Layer 2 spanned networks. We had done this successfully already in the off-campus environment, but not with the multi-fabric setup.

 

I’ll briefly explain but perhaps a call might help if that is possible? 

 

So, we have a Cisco switch connected to CC-BL . The Cisco switch hosts an SVI (VLAN 200 in the lab) and also an OSPF adjacency with CC-BL (using VLAN 951). What we have noticed is:

*	All VTEP devices see all consistent information in:

	*	Vrf campus RIB
	*	BGP L2VPN EVPN

*	Only CC-BL and CL-BL can source a ping from their VRF campus loopbacks and local SVIs and reach the SVI hosted on Cisco (VLAN 200) – all other VTEPs cannot do this
*	The Cisco VLAN 200 SVI is fully reachable via VLAN 200 clients in the fabric no matter which VTEP they are connected to.
*	VLAN 200 clients in the fabric can actually ping SVIs and loopbacks in the fabric (e.g. Colo loopback in vrf campus) suggesting we are routing via the Cisco into the fabric ok, however the reverse ping is not functional

 

I’m drawing a bit of a blank on it at the moment and will need to dismantle the lab shortly for equipment redeploy – no doubt we will seek to come back to this after we do get the kit redeployed but thought it might be of interest to you before we down the lab as it might take a few weeks to reinstate this scenario after next week.

 

Many thanks,

Hi All,

Just to clarify I carried out some onsite testing at the HPE Aruba lab in Winnersh before Christmas, I arranged it through our channel SE Kevin Crehan and I was accompanied by Ash Sharma (before he left). We were able to complete a significant amount of testing and configuration development, however, the lab had to be tore down after two or three visits to be used for another customer.

I then passed on these configs to the NU team who assembled their own test rig based on my design so we could continue the testing, which we have done and have made some progress in terms of the multi-fabric connectivity, though we are still trying to iron out a couple of things.

So Kevin is right, we did not successfully complete the lab testing at HPE Aruba as this was mainly down to us running out of time before the lab space being reallocated.

Thanks,
Simon

Hi David, 

 

Sure, just let us know some dates and Graham and I can confirm – looking at calendars W/C 17th Feb looks good except for the 19th , W/C 24th looks ok apart from the 27th. 

 

As discussed, we need to understand what Kevin is referring to when he says…

 

“I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it.

….as I’m not aware of Aruba being involved in / committing to any lab testing for the project. 

 

Cheers, 

 

Mike.

Subject: Northumbria University - Site Meeting

 

Simon, Mike,

 

Kevin is chasing for a date to get a meeting set up so I am looking for dates so we can get this in place . . . 

Kevin wants a meeting to discuss the following key points:

 

1.	Phase 2 Orders: He wants to review the next phase of orders, specifically covering the remaining distribution and aggregation switches. The goal is to install all key Aruba switches.
2.	Project Structure for Phase 1 Delivery: Kevin is looking to structure the delivery process for Phase 1. He mentioned a deadline at the end of May to avoid issues with university clearing, meaning that timelines and logistics need to be aligned.
3.	Delivery Date Estimates for Phase 1: He has requested an update on estimated delivery dates for the equipment in Phase 1.
4.	Multifabric Lab Testing & Progress: There is an issue with the multifabric lab environment. Northumbria has stood up a lab environment, but Kevin is unsure if sufficient work has been carried out to prove the solution works.

 

Kevin is calling the next Phase, Phase 2 but to avoid any doubt, for us this would be Phase 4.

 

We want to get out of this a strategy, timeline and design, as well as understanding what has actually been deployed, and integrated. Also need to define what they are doing and what they want us to do.

 

Can you both look in your calendars and suggest a date? It will be onsite.

P.S. Simon can you review the attached document and let me know of any changes?

 

Thanks,

Thanks Aj, & hi Ben, 

Happy to run you through our platform. It will likely take around an hour.  I can do any time PM Thursday or Friday or PM next week with the exception of Wednesday. 

Do you want to let me know when is best? Once confirmed I will send out a Teams meeting to all.

Hi Ajay,


Thank you again for yesterday.  Great to better understand the Bechtle proposition. 

 

I’ve followed up with the team today and I know the guys are very interested in seeing the Bechtle Direct portal, understand how it can be customised as well as having a deep dive in to the pillars.  I’ll follow up with you to work out a few dates where we may be able to organise some additional sessions.

 

Have a good weekend all!

Hi Ajay,


Thank you again for yesterday.  Great to better understand the Bechtle proposition. 

 

I’ve followed up with the team today and I know the guys are very interested in seeing the Bechtle Direct portal, understand how it can be customised as well as having a deep dive in to the pillars.  I’ll follow up with you to work out a few dates where we may be able to organise some additional sessions.

 

Have a good weekend all!

Hi David, 

 

Sure, just let us know some dates and Graham and I can confirm – looking at calendars W/C 17th Feb looks good except for the 19th , W/C 24th looks ok apart from the 27th. 

 

As discussed, we need to understand what Kevin is referring to when he says…

 

“I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it. We need to have the confidence that the multi fabric solution is going to work in our environment.”

 

….as I’m not aware of Aruba being involved in / committing to any lab testing for the project. 

 

Cheers, 

 

Mike.

Subject: Northumbria University - Site Meeting

 

Simon, Mike,

 

Kevin is chasing for a date to get a meeting set up so I am looking for dates so we can get this in place . . . 

Kevin wants a meeting to discuss the following key points:

 

1.	Phase 2 Orders: He wants to review the next phase of orders, specifically covering the remaining distribution and aggregation switches. The goal is to install all key Aruba switches.
2.	Project Structure for Phase 1 Delivery: Kevin is looking to structure the delivery process for Phase 1. He mentioned a deadline at the end of May to avoid issues with university clearing, meaning that timelines and logistics need to be aligned.
3.	Delivery Date Estimates for Phase 1: He has requested an update on estimated delivery dates for the equipment in Phase 1.
4.	Multifabric Lab Testing & Progress: There is an issue with the multifabric lab environment. Northumbria has stood up a lab environment, but Kevin is unsure if sufficient work has been carried out to prove the solution works.

 

Kevin is calling the next Phase, Phase 2 but to avoid any doubt, for us this would be Phase 4.

 

We want to get out of this a strategy, timeline and design, as well as understanding what has actually been deployed, and integrated. Also need to define what they are doing and what they want us to do.

 

Can you both look in your calendars and suggest a date? It will be onsite.

P.S. Simon can you review the attached document and let me know of any changes?

 

Thanks,

I have raised a quote for AP-587s for the distributor so he can work out how many you can have. Just waiting on the distributor now and hopefully have something for you soon.

Hi David, 

 

We have 12 AP585's remaining that we would like to swap for AP587. Could you let us know how many AP587s we could get by returning these please?

 

These are the serial numbers:

CNQGL1M02V

CNQGL1M06H

CNPSL1M01T

CNQGL1M03Y

CNQGL1M04D

CNQGL1M06G

CNQGL1M00G

CNQGL1M06F

CNQGL1M035

CNQGL1M06L

CNPSL1M01B

CNQGL1M055

 

They are all still boxed and haven't been undone.

 

We are also looking for a couple of extra AP-270-MNT-H1 mounts. Could we get a price for these please?

 

Thanks,

Mat

Hola,

Your defo losing it mate. ??

 

My suggestion was you send me a quote for the switch and a PO get’s raised against that but you don’t provision the switch, instead you just adjust the credit balance.

 

That then allows a future order to be placed against the outstanding credit.

 

That work?

 

Gies a shout this afternoon and we can discuss.

Afternoon Alan,

 

Haha, well you’re definitely top of my list today! ??

 

Quick update for you:

*	AV Equipment (Transmitter/Receiver): Ordered, just waiting on an ETA—I’m chasing that up now and will let you know once I have a confirmed delivery date.
*	Credit for the Switch: Unfortunately as the switch has been invoiced etc there isn’t anything I can do with that. However I’m happy to look at alternatives if you have any ideas?

 

Appreciate your patience, and I’ll keep you posted as soon as I get the final confirmations. Let me know if you want to jump on a call later to run through anything.

 

Cheers,

Apologies, one of our customers had an issue on Friday and had to sort that out, and unfortunately it slipped my mind. I'm out this afternoon but you're top of my list and I'll get that sorted by tomorrow.

 

Apologies again Alan, I'm on it now.

Hi David,

Don’t know if I missed your call on Friday but would be good to grab five minutes to close off the two outstanding order requirements.

 

I checked with Admin team today and there’s been no delivery of the transmitter/receiver yet. If you can let me know where that’s at and whether we can sort a quote for the switch to recover the credit balance.

Hi David,

Thanks for your time earlier, hope it wasn’t too much of a wasted time given you’d pulled in other folks on your side?

 

I’d hoped we’d wrap up a bit earlier and I’d have the chance for a catch up.

 

If you give me a shout on the mobile tomorrow we can cover off today’s discussions and the outstanding switch/order.

So if you issue a new quote, just based on same description, I can get a PO raised and you just invoice us as normal?

 

Then you just don’t provision the network switch and the value goes back to the credit instead, does that work?

Hi David,

I think this was the one for the network switch that we did through the credit.

 

If it saves you some effort you could just resend that with an updated date, or is that just muddying the waters?

Alan,

 

Here is your quote for the switch. I should point out though that I was expecting slightly more discount than we got, so I have asked for it to be escalated and should receive that back by tomorrow. 

However, it has taken a bit longer than usual, so I thought best to send you what we have just now in case you need to get moving on it. Also, I have included a power supply as that will be needed for this switch.

 

Let me know if there is anything else that you need.

 

P.S. If I get improved pricing back, I will share it with you regardless, but if you need to order straight away I will take the difference off of the order for Colin, so you still pay the same if that makes sense.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

Hi Simon, 

 

Please can I chase a response for David , as I have mentioned before we do need to keep the momentum going on this project. 

 

I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it. We need to have the confidence that the multi fabric solution is going to work in our environment. 

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Subject: Multifabric Lab - weird reachability issue

 

Hi Simon,

 

We’ve run into an issue in the lab environment.

 

Len suggested we extend the lab, in order to include a Cisco device that was hosting an SVI as a gateway for Layer 2 spanned networks. We had done this successfully already in the off-campus environment, but not with the multi-fabric setup.

 

I’ll briefly explain but perhaps a call might help if that is possible? 

 

So, we have a Cisco switch connected to CC-BL . The Cisco switch hosts an SVI (VLAN 200 in the lab) and also an OSPF adjacency with CC-BL (using VLAN 951). What we have noticed is:

*	All VTEP devices see all consistent information in:

	*	Vrf campus RIB
	*	BGP L2VPN EVPN

*	Only CC-BL and CL-BL can source a ping from their VRF campus loopbacks and local SVIs and reach the SVI hosted on Cisco (VLAN 200) – all other VTEPs cannot do this
*	The Cisco VLAN 200 SVI is fully reachable via VLAN 200 clients in the fabric no matter which VTEP they are connected to.
*	VLAN 200 clients in the fabric can actually ping SVIs and loopbacks in the fabric (e.g. Colo loopback in vrf campus) suggesting we are routing via the Cisco into the fabric ok, however the reverse ping is not functional

 

I’m drawing a bit of a blank on it at the moment and will need to dismantle the lab shortly for equipment redeploy – no doubt we will seek to come back to this after we do get the kit redeployed but thought it might be of interest to you before we down the lab as it might take a few weeks to reinstate this scenario after next week.

 

Many thanks,

Hi Simon, 

 

Please can I chase a response for David , as I have mentioned before we do need to keep the momentum going on this project. 

 

I do have concerns that Aruba and Qolcom did not successful complete a Lab to test all aspects for this project and asked if the Uni can stand up a lab for this , which we have done. Since the lab has been created, I am not aware that have been able to carry out a lot of work on it. We need to have the confidence that the multi fabric solution is going to work in our environment. 

 

Thanks,

Kevin.

Subject: Multifabric Lab - weird reachability issue

 

Hi Simon,

 

We’ve run into an issue in the lab environment.

 

Len suggested we extend the lab, in order to include a Cisco device that was hosting an SVI as a gateway for Layer 2 spanned networks. We had done this successfully already in the off-campus environment, but not with the multi-fabric setup.

 

I’ll briefly explain but perhaps a call might help if that is possible? 

 

So, we have a Cisco switch connected to CC-BL . The Cisco switch hosts an SVI (VLAN 200 in the lab) and also an OSPF adjacency with CC-BL (using VLAN 951). What we have noticed is:

*	All VTEP devices see all consistent information in:

	*	Vrf campus RIB
	*	BGP L2VPN EVPN

*	Only CC-BL and CL-BL can source a ping from their VRF campus loopbacks and local SVIs and reach the SVI hosted on Cisco (VLAN 200) – all other VTEPs cannot do this
*	The Cisco VLAN 200 SVI is fully reachable via VLAN 200 clients in the fabric no matter which VTEP they are connected to.
*	VLAN 200 clients in the fabric can actually ping SVIs and loopbacks in the fabric (e.g. Colo loopback in vrf campus) suggesting we are routing via the Cisco into the fabric ok, however the reverse ping is not functional

 

I’m drawing a bit of a blank on it at the moment and will need to dismantle the lab shortly for equipment redeploy – no doubt we will seek to come back to this after we do get the kit redeployed but thought it might be of interest to you before we down the lab as it might take a few weeks to reinstate this scenario after next week.

 

Many thanks,

Hi David,

 

Not sure what to go back to Bob with on this one…

 

I have sent the hide pricing quote so everything is bundled into two lines. Attached is the unbundled price which shows zero costs to St Helen’s for the sensors which I’m guessing you chucked in to sweeten the deal when you quoted it…

 

What do you want me to do?

Alan,

 

Apologies, one of our customers had an issue on Friday and had to sort that out, and unfortunately it slipped my mind. I'm out this afternoon but you're top of my list and I'll get that sorted by tomorrow.

 

Apologies again Alan, I'm on it now.

 

Thanks,

 

David

Hi David,

Don’t know if I missed your call on Friday but would be good to grab five minutes to close off the two outstanding order requirements.

 

I checked with Admin team today and there’s been no delivery of the transmitter/receiver yet. If you can let me know where that’s at and whether we can sort a quote for the switch to recover the credit balance.

Hi David,

Thanks for your time earlier, hope it wasn’t too much of a wasted time given you’d pulled in other folks on your side?

 

I’d hoped we’d wrap up a bit earlier and I’d have the chance for a catch up.

 

If you give me a shout on the mobile tomorrow we can cover off today’s discussions and the outstanding switch/order.

So if you issue a new quote, just based on same description, I can get a PO raised and you just invoice us as normal?

 

Then you just don’t provision the network switch and the value goes back to the credit instead, does that work?

As it's been invoiced and paid, unfortunately I can't do anything with that quote, however I'm having a look to see what else I can do to give you the same outcome.

Hi David,

I think this was the one for the network switch that we did through the credit.

 

If it saves you some effort you could just resend that with an updated date, or is that just muddying the waters?

Alan,

 

Here is your quote for the switch. I should point out though that I was expecting slightly more discount than we got, so I have asked for it to be escalated and should receive that back by tomorrow. 

However, it has taken a bit longer than usual, so I thought best to send you what we have just now in case you need to get moving on it. Also, I have included a power supply as that will be needed for this switch.

 

Let me know if there is anything else that you need.

 

P.S. If I get improved pricing back, I will share it with you regardless, but if you need to order straight away I will take the difference off of the order for Colin, so you still pay the same if that makes sense.

 

Thanks,

 

David Dunlop

Subject: Northumbria Uni - Fabric / Netconductor conversation 

Hi Team, 

 

As discussed, Simon from partner Qolcom is working with Northumbria University on a fabric core project replacing Cisco with Aruba. 

 

Currently the approach is manual configuration but Simon and the University are keen to understand whether Central Netconductor could provide a better approach. 

 

You will all be at the TSS event in Vienna, so hopefully you can meet up there to discuss. In the meantime could we look to arrange a call sometime next week to talk through the project and where Netconductor might figure?

Mike.

Subject: Northumbria Uni - Fabric / Netconductor conversation 

Hi Team, 

 

As discussed, Simon from partner Qolcom is working with Northumbria University on a fabric core project replacing Cisco with Aruba. 

 

Currently the approach is manual configuration but Simon and the University are keen to understand whether Central Netconductor could provide a better approach. 

 

You will all be at the TSS event in Vienna, so hopefully you can meet up there to discuss. In the meantime could we look to arrange a call sometime next week to talk through the project and where Netconductor might figure?

Mike.

Good afternoon David,  

We help IT Services SME businesses hire top IT Sales & Technical talent within 21 days, leveraging 15 years of expertise to find candidates who drive growth. Would this be something that could be relevant to you or maybe another team member at Qolcom?

Specifically, I am reaching out about a Business Development and Account Management professional with over a decade of experience delivering top-tier B2B technical solutions. Lewis has continually exceeded sales targets, achieving outstanding performances including closing £1M against a £500K target in 2023 and securing £400K in just two quarters of 2024. He has demonstrated a proven ability to grow new business revenue, contributing up to 70% of annual results in recent years.


Would it be useful if I shared a short video to explain this?


Warm regards,
Sue Southall | Managing Director

	? 
	Here is their differentiator ...

	Software Asset Management (SAM) is a **strategic approach** to managing, optimizing, and controlling an organization's software licenses and assets. It ensures that software investments are **cost-effective, compliant, and fully utilized** across an organization.

	### **Key Benefits of SAM**
	1. **Cost Optimization** – Avoid overpaying for unused or underutilized licenses.
	2. **Compliance & Risk Management** – Reduce the risk of software audits, non-compliance fines, and legal risks.
	3. **License Optimization** – Ensure you have the right licenses for your needs, neither over- nor under-licensed.
	4. **Security & Standardization** – Identify outdated, unsupported, or redundant software that may introduce security risks.
	5. **Cloud & Hybrid Management** – Manage software across on-premise, cloud, and hybrid environments.

	---

	### **How Does Bechtle’s SAM Differ from Standard License Sales?**
	Most Microsoft resellers simply sell licenses, but Bechtle offers **end-to-end** SAM services to help organizations manage their software more effectively. 

	#### **1. Bechtle's SAM Services**
	- **SAM as a Service** – Continuous, proactive monitoring and optimization of software usage.
	- **SAM Baseline** – A one-time analysis to assess software inventory, compliance, and optimization opportunities.
	- **SAM Cloud Readiness** – Evaluates your current software setup and prepares for cloud transition (Azure, M365, etc.).
	- **SAM Consulting & Audits** – Expert advisory to avoid compliance risks and unexpected costs.

	#### **2. How Bechtle Adds Value**
	- **Microsoft Licensing Expertise** – Bechtle helps organizations navigate complex Microsoft licensing models (M365, Azure, CSP, EA, SPLA, etc.).
	- **Automated Software Tracking** – Uses **SAM tools** to track software deployment, usage, and renewal dates.
	- **Audit-Readiness & Risk Mitigation** – Prepares companies for potential vendor audits by ensuring compliance.

	---

	### **Why Choose Bechtle for Microsoft Licensing?**
	? **Cost Efficiency** – Bechtle ensures you're **not paying for unnecessary licenses** while staying compliant.  
	? **Cloud Optimization** – Helps companies **transition to the cloud efficiently** while managing hybrid environments.  
	? **Proactive Compliance Management** – Minimizes risks of **unexpected audits or license breaches**.  
	? **Enterprise-Level Reporting & Insights** – Organizations get **visibility** into their software usage, waste, and renewal cycles.  

	---

	### **Is SAM Worth It?**
	If your organization:
	- Spends **a significant amount** on Microsoft licenses.
	- Uses **hybrid or multi-cloud environments** (M365, Azure, on-prem).
	- Wants to **optimize IT budgets** and reduce software overspending.
	- Wants to be **audit-ready** and ensure compliance.

	Then **SAM services** like those offered by Bechtle can provide **long-term cost savings and risk reduction** beyond just buying licenses.

	Would you like a comparison of Bechtle’s SAM services vs. other major Microsoft resellers like Softcat, Insight, or Bytes?

Hi Heidi,

 

This is in relation to the Aberdeen Uni quote we spoke about last week. To hopefully make this easier, I’ve separated from the original quote and created a new opportunity. Hopefully that should make the admin easier when the ‘kit’ PO comes in shortly. I had believed it was going to be ordered in its entirety.

Hi David,

 

Not sure what to go back to Bob with on this one…

 

I have sent the hide pricing quote so everything is bundled into two lines. Attached is the unbundled price which shows zero costs to St Helen’s for the sensors which I’m guessing you chucked in to sweeten the deal when you quoted it…

 

What do you want me to do?

 

Thanks,

H Andrew,

 

There is a HLD for the overall fabric solution which we have proposed, though no specific proposal has been created for the professional services piece.

 

Let’s schedule a call for next week when I am back in the UK to go over the requirements.

 

Thanks,

Simon

Hi Heidi

 

I have had feedback from Excel and they have said the yellow and green 0.3m patch leads have been discontinued. 

 

They can supply these sizes in the 0.3m in a mini patch lead.

 

I have attached the spec sheet, not sure if this would be acceptable ??

Hi Heidi

 

I have had feedback from Excel and they have said the yellow and green 0.3m patch leads have been discontinued. 

 

They can supply these sizes in the 0.3m in a mini patch lead.

 

I have attached the spec sheet, not sure if this would be acceptable ??

There is a HLD for the overall fabric solution which we have proposed, though no specific proposal has been created for the professional services piece.

Hi Dave,

 

I think we would prefer to have these thinner patch leads going forward as they are a lot easier to work with, however they need to be provided in the colours that have been requested.

[EXTERNAL EMAIL]

Michael, Kevin, Lisa, Nuaim,

 

Quick update on the patch cables for your various orders — our supplier has informed us that the 0.3m yellow and green Excel patch leads have been discontinued. However, they’ve suggested an alternative:

Excel Cat6A Mini Patch Leads (0.3m, 28AWG, LSOH, Blade Booted), which offer:

 

*	Same Cat6A spec, supporting 10GBase-T and PoE++.
*	Thinner, more flexible design (4.8mm diameter), making cable management easier.
*	Screened shielding for better signal integrity.
*	Smaller RJ45 connectors, designed for high-density patching.

 

The main difference is that these are mini patch leads, meaning a slightly thinner cable and smaller connectors compared to standard ones. I’ve attached the spec sheet so you can review the details.

Let me know your thoughts.

 

Cheers,

 

David Dunlop

Kevin, Michael,

 

Apologies for the delay in this one. This kit had been added to a single quote from Aruba for the access layer refresh and the AP-655s that were ordered, but unfortunately Aruba didn’t let me or anyone else know they had bundled this all together.

 

There is a delay for patch leads until March so I hope that isn’t going to cause you any further delays.

 

Thanks,

Hi David,

Don’t know if I missed your call on Friday but would be good to grab five minutes to close off the two outstanding order requirements.

 

I checked with Admin team today and there’s been no delivery of the transmitter/receiver yet. If you can let me know where that’s at and whether we can sort a quote for the switch to recover the credit balance.

Hi David,

Thanks for your time earlier, hope it wasn’t too much of a wasted time given you’d pulled in other folks on your side?

 

I’d hoped we’d wrap up a bit earlier and I’d have the chance for a catch up.

 

If you give me a shout on the mobile tomorrow we can cover off today’s discussions and the outstanding switch/order.

So if you issue a new quote, just based on same description, I can get a PO raised and you just invoice us as normal?

 

Then you just don’t provision the network switch and the value goes back to the credit instead, does that work?

Hi David,

I think this was the one for the network switch that we did through the credit.

 

If it saves you some effort you could just resend that with an updated date, or is that just muddying the waters?

Alan,

 

Here is your quote for the switch. I should point out though that I was expecting slightly more discount than we got, so I have asked for it to be escalated and should receive that back by tomorrow. 

However, it has taken a bit longer than usual, so I thought best to send you what we have just now in case you need to get moving on it. Also, I have included a power supply as that will be needed for this switch.

 

Let me know if there is anything else that you need.

 

P.S. If I get improved pricing back, I will share it with you regardless, but if you need to order straight away I will take the difference off of the order for Colin, so you still pay the same if that makes sense.

 

Thanks,

Hi Patricia, 

 

Further to the call this morning, I’ve made some rough notes about the themes we could lead with, I’m confident that they fall back to products and solutions that we offer and some flow through to Bechtle which is nice. I’m not sure how similar these are to the research paper you mentioned? 

 

Digital Transformation

*	Student Centric Digital Services (self registration, hybrid learning, home from home, mobile first access)
*	Modern Infrastructure (cloud migration,5G, AR/VR)
*	Smart Campus (IoT, location services)
*	Digital Skills (innovative teaching, emerging technologies, tech literacy) 

Sustainability 

*	Energy Efficient Networks (green IT, hybrid cloud)
*	Environmental Monitoring 
*	Sustainable Procurement / Recycling 
*	Awareness Campaigns / Gamification 

Operational Experience 

*	Automation (configuration, patch management, backups, firmware updates)
*	Proactive Monitoring and Troubleshooting 
*	Trusted Support (out of hours, monitoring, consultancy, thought leadership)
*	Commercial Models (shifting to predictable spend, hardware refreshes, XaaS)

 

I think the 4 Stage Approach video that we’ve already created and used is a great starting point, perhaps tweaking the words slightly and including some vendors at the end showing who we’re proud to partner with as a foundation to the strategy. 

 

Happy to have a chat and run through again or leave this with you to come up with something? 

 

Kind regards, 

 

Neil Wheeler
