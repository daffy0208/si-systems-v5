*   **WHY** – Clarify your purpose, values, and motivations.
*   **WHAT** – Define roles, strengths, outputs.
*   **HOW** – Understand your thinking style, work habits, and learning preferences.
*   **Integration** – Use tools like the Shadow Planner to keep things on track.

* * *

### **2\. Work/Project BrainFrame**

Apply BrainFrame to a business goal, customer, or project.

*   **Customer Strategy** (e.g., Durham University, Northumbria)
*   **Sales Opportunity** (e.g., planning a new pitch or engagement)
*   **Vendor/Technology Positioning** (e.g., Aruba, SSE, ClearPass)
*   **Productivity & Task Flow** (e.g., using ChatGPT/Copilot more effectively)

* * *

### **3\. Team/Development BrainFrame**

Structure development for individuals or roles.

*   **Thorn Athletic Players** – e.g., No.8 Role Development Pack.
*   **Training & Performance** – Build clarity and confidence.
*   **‘If This, Then That’ guides** – Improve decision-making.

* * *

### **4\. Setup & Navigation**

You can now:

*   Ask **“Show me the live BrainFrame map”**
*   Launch **any module** directly (e.g. “Run Role Tension Radar”)
*   Say “**Review deferred items**” to revisit anything parked in earlier versions
*   Or ask, “**What’s different about this version for me?**” for a personalised summary
