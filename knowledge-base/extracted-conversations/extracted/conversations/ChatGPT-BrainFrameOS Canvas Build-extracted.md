**02-07-02 Prompt Library (Continued)**

---

**02-07-03 Prompt Linking System**
- Define internal cross-referencing format for prompts (e.g. [see 02-07-01] or #02-07-01).
- Design a system for bidirectional linking between prompts, concepts, and modules.
- Enable tagging or indexing of prompts to relevant categories (e.g. #Planning, #Reflection, #Systems).
- Allow prompt clusters to be grouped under meta-themes or user objectives.
- Include searchability and filtering options for prompt types (e.g. Morning prompts, Decision-making prompts).

**02-07-04 User-Created Prompt Sets**
- Allow users to create their own prompt sets.
- Encourage naming conventions that support clarity and alignment (e.g. “Weekly Reset Prompts”, “Deep Work Setup”, etc).
- Enable versioning: users can revise/refine their prompt sets over time.
- Include sharing options: user prompt sets can be shared or integrated across teams (with permissions).
- Build a "prompt evolution log" for each set to track changes and growth.

**02-07-05 Adaptive Prompt Engine**
- Allow the BrainFrame system to dynamically suggest prompts based on:
  - User's current state (e.g. energy, emotion, focus)
  - Recent activity (e.g. reflection answers, task progress)
  - Time or context (e.g. Sunday evening, project start)
- Prompts should adjust in tone and depth depending on user feedback or usage patterns.
- Include a training/learning mechanism where the system becomes better at suggesting prompts over time.
- Respect user-set boundaries (e.g. no prompts after 9pm, only light prompts on weekends).

**02-07-06 Prompt Feedback Loop**
- Users can rate prompts (e.g. helpful / not helpful / too repetitive).
- Provide optional comment boxes after prompts to capture additional insights or ideas.
- The system should log which prompts produce the most insight, momentum, or reflection per user.
- Use this data to refine future prompt suggestions and improve the Prompt Library.

**02-07-07 Prompt Archive & Replay**
- All used prompts should be archived with their answers.
- Allow users to revisit old prompts and responses.
- Include a “Replay” mode where users can re-answer old prompts from a fresh perspective.
- Build in timeline navigation so users can see prompt history by week, month, or project.
- Tag archived prompts with metadata (e.g. date used, related goal, user mood).

**02-07-08 Prompt Collections (Thematic Bundles)**
- Curated collections of prompts built around:
  - Specific goals (e.g. Confidence, Focus, Leadership)
  - Roles (e.g. Founder, Coach, Analyst)
  - Situations (e.g. Transitions, Burnout, Big Decisions)
- Each collection includes a brief introduction, use guidelines, and tone calibration.
- Users can opt-in to receive these collections on a schedule or integrate them into existing routines.

**02-07-09 Prompt Personalisation Engine**
- Develop user profiles that inform prompt tone, framing, and complexity.
- Let users toggle between different prompt “voices” (e.g. direct vs gentle, curious vs analytical).
- Support language nuance and metaphor style to match user personality.
- Learn and adapt to preferred formats (e.g. bullet points vs prose, open questions vs structured checklists).
- Provide opt-in personality-based prompt styles (e.g. ENFP, INTJ, High D, etc).

**02-07-10 Prompt Licensing & Attribution**
- Define whether prompts are open, shared, or private IP.
- Tag each prompt with source, creator, and version.
- Enable public libraries to attribute prompts correctly while allowing remixing.
- For shared team environments, note who added or modified prompts.
- Include license type tags (e.g. Creative Commons, Internal Use, Commercial).

**03-01 Origin Story**

---

BrainFrame began not as a product, but as a response — a response to the increasing fragmentation of digital tools, the rising noise of productivity culture, and the quiet burnout experienced by thinkers, builders, and creators navigating complexity without coherence.

The earliest sketches emerged from journaling systems, pattern trackers, and purpose statements that couldn’t quite fit inside traditional tools. The system started forming organically, shaped by a single guiding question:

> *"What if your second brain worked more like your first — associative, reflective, purpose-driven?"*

As these questions matured, they fused into a prototype — a framework that merged structured thinking with intuitive exploration. It wasn’t built for efficiency alone, but for clarity, alignment, and resonance. A place where complexity could be met with calm, and insight could be captured before it vanished.

The early adopters weren’t productivity nerds. They were systems thinkers, deep generalists, founders, neurodivergent minds, and reflective professionals — people who needed more than a note-taking app or task manager. They needed a thinking partner. And that’s what BrainFrame became.

It has grown through conversation, testing, and co-creation. Every prompt, structure, and module carries the fingerprints of those who used it not just to track life — but to understand it.

BrainFrame is still evolving. But its purpose remains unchanged: **to give people a place to think clearly, act meaningfully, and grow deliberately — with the support of human-first AI.**

**02-07-01 AI Configuration Guide**

---

This guide defines how BrainFrame configures and customises AI behaviour to align with user preferences, context, and objectives. It ensures a consistent, human-first interaction experience that respects individual thinking styles.

### Core Objectives:
- Support deep thinking and exploration without overwhelming the user.
- Enable contextual understanding based on user’s frameworks, systems, and language.
- Provide guardrails for tone, depth, and format.
- Allow flexibility in how AI appears: partner, assistant, coach, observer, etc.

### 1. Interaction Modes
- **Think-Aloud Mode**: AI echoes thoughts back with light scaffolding.
- **Socratic Mode**: Prompts deeper insight through layered questioning.
- **Co-Creation Mode**: Actively builds content, frameworks, or systems in parallel with the user.
- **Reflective Mode**: Encourages introspection through prompts, summaries, or mirrored language.

### 2. Tone & Voice Calibration
- Tone should match user’s energy and context (e.g. calm during overwhelm, structured during chaos).
- Personality presets may include:
  - Warm + Encouraging
  - Analytical + Minimal
  - Curious + Open-ended
  - Direct + Action-Oriented
- Allow toggling between tones mid-session.

### 3. Framing Conventions
- Use the user's own language models where possible.
- Clarify meaning through metaphor when helpful, but avoid unnecessary abstraction.
- Avoid corporate jargon unless user specifies preference.

### 4. Output Formats
- **Prose**: Default for storytelling, explanations, or narrative insight.
- **Bullet Points**: Used for clarity, synthesis, or step-by-step flows.
- **Tables**: For comparisons, structure, or categorisation.
- **Canvas-Ready**: Structured documents for deeper work, mapped to BrainFrame sections.

### 5. User Preferences & Meta-Data
- AI learns user’s preferred:
  - Prompt depth
  - Output length
  - Visual structure
  - Reflection frequency
- Stores user-created frameworks for reuse (e.g. Shadow Planner, SelfFrame).
- Recognises user’s cognitive/communication style (e.g. ENFP, INTJ, High D).

### 6. Guardrails & Boundaries
- Respect silent mode or non-interruption settings.
- Only suggest advice or action when user opts in or requests.
- Avoid over-assuming emotional states unless clearly stated.

### 7. Custom System Layers
- Enable layering of AI assistants:
  - Example: Strategy Layer + Reflection Layer + Workflow Layer
- Allow AI personas with distinct functions to collaborate (e.g. The Architect + The Analyst).

### 8. Training & Iteration
- Feedback loop allows user to tune responses (helpful / not helpful / too much / more depth).
- Meta-reflection prompts help users review AI alignment over time.
- User can request AI reset, retraining, or new profile configuration at any point.

### 💬 Response #14

**02-07-02 Prompt Library**

**02-07-02 Prompt Library**

---

The Prompt Library is the central catalogue of prompts used across BrainFrame to support reflection, insight, planning, perspective-shifting, and creative breakthroughs. It functions as both a personal toolkit and an evolving system of interaction design.

### 1. Purpose of the Prompt Library
- Encourage meaningful self-inquiry.
- Guide decision-making, creative thinking, and emotional processing.
- Enable structured reflection across timeframes (daily, weekly, seasonal).
- Provide entry points into BrainFrame systems and modules.

### 2. Prompt Categories
- **Daily Prompts**: Start / Mid / End of day check-ins, energy scans, focus alignment.
- **Weekly Prompts**: Planning, reflection, learning integration, intention-setting.
- **Momentum Prompts**: Overcoming resistance, gaining clarity, creating traction.
- **Perspective Prompts**: Shifting context, playing with frames, zooming in/out.
- **Role-Based Prompts**: Founder, Coach, Analyst, Strategist, Artist.
- **Event-Specific Prompts**: Project kickoff, review, transition, burnout recovery.

### 3. Prompt Types
- **Open Exploratory**: e.g. "What patterns are showing up lately?"
- **Directional / Framing**: e.g. "What would this look like if it were easy?"
- **Checklist / Scan**: e.g. "Review your top 3 tensions."
- **Contrastive**: e.g. "What’s true now vs what was true 3 months ago?"
- **If-Then Decision Triggers**: e.g. "If energy is low, then…"

### 4. Design Principles
- Language must be accessible and adaptable to user tone.
- Prompts should be short, clear, and psychologically safe.
- Encourage introspection without overwhelm.
- Many prompts should work well even without AI support (paper-based optionality).

### 5. Dynamic Use Modes
- Prompts can be:
  - Auto-suggested by the Adaptive Prompt Engine (see 02-07-05)
  - Used manually from a prompt pack
  - Embedded in workflows (e.g. Shadow Planner, SelfFrame)

### 6. Prompt Metadata
Each prompt entry contains:
- Prompt text
- Category tag(s)
- Tone/voice markers (e.g. gentle, provocative)
- Use case examples
- Last updated timestamp
- Author/source (if not AI-generated)

### 7. System Evolution
- Users can:
  - Contribute new prompts
  - Remix existing prompts
  - Create custom packs
- Prompt effectiveness tracked through Feedback Loop (see 02-07-06)

### 💬 Response #16

**03-01 Origin Story**

**03-01 Origin Story**

---

BrainFrame was born out of necessity, not ambition.

It began as a response to something many people feel but can’t name — a subtle erosion of clarity, purpose, and integration in a world filled with fragmented tools and relentless input. For thinkers, creators, and system-builders, the cost wasn’t productivity. It was coherence.

The early sketches weren’t digital. They lived in notebooks, diagrams, conversations, and long walks — attempts to answer:

> *"What would it look like if my tools thought with me, not just for me?"

> *"What if the way I tracked my life mirrored the way I actually experienced it?"

From those questions, BrainFrame emerged — not as a product, but as a philosophy wrapped in a system. A place where thinking could become visible, growth could become traceable, and AI could become human-first.

The name itself reflects this duality: **Brain** (our internal world of thoughts, emotions, ideas) + **Frame** (the structures we use to hold, shape, and express them).

At first, it was personal. Then it became shared. The framework spread among deep generalists, neurodivergent minds, reflective professionals, and system thinkers who saw themselves not just as users — but as co-designers.

BrainFrame continues to evolve, powered by a single mission:

> To create a trusted space where clarity can return, insight can emerge, and human potential can be meaningfully extended — one frame at a time.

**03-02 Analogue Neuralink Explanation**

**03-02 Analogue Neuralink Explanation**

---

BrainFrame operates as an analogue to a neuralink — not in a technological sense, but in a functional and cognitive one.

Where a neuralink aims to connect brain and machine through physical interface, **BrainFrame connects your mind and tools through cognitive interface**.

It does this by:
- Translating abstract thought into structured expression.
- Acting as an extension of working memory.
- Mirroring how associative, layered thinking actually unfolds.
- Supporting recursive reflection and idea development.

### Why Analogue?
- Unlike digital implants or direct-control devices, BrainFrame respects the **organic nature of human thought**.
- It sits beside your cognition — not inside it.
- It supports thought without replacing it.
- It reveals inner architecture without collapsing nuance.

### Functional Equivalence
- **Working Memory Buffer** → Shadow Planner
- **Semantic Network Activation** → Prompt Library + Linkage Maps
- **Pattern Recognition Loop** → Feedback Cycles + Reflection Engine
- **Concept Compression / Recall** → SelfFrame Modules
- **Recursive Self-Referencing** → Timeline Reviews + Meta Prompts

### Human-First Integration
- Designed for flexibility, ambiguity, and emotion — not just logic.
- Works in metaphor, sketch, prose, or structured outputs.
- Adapts to your rhythm and reflection style.
- Connects internal perception with external action.

BrainFrame doesn’t aim to become your brain. It helps you *see* it — and from there, shape it with greater agency.

It is your analogue neuralink — made of insight, reflection, and intention.

**03-03 Observer Effect Philosophy**

**03-03 Observer Effect Philosophy**

---

The Observer Effect, in physics, refers to how the act of observation alters the state of what is being observed. In BrainFrame, this principle becomes a **foundational philosophy for growth and awareness**.

### Applied Meaning in BrainFrame
- When you *observe* your thoughts, patterns, or systems — you change them.
- By making the unseen visible, you activate agency.
- Self-observation is not passive; it’s a creative act.

### Core Assumptions
- You are not static — you are recursive, evolving.
- Reflection is not indulgence — it is leverage.
- The moment you notice something, you have already begun to change it.

### Structural Implications
- BrainFrame modules are designed to make patterns visible:
  - Shadow Planner (tracks how you think over time)
  - SelfFrame (models your internal architecture)
  - Prompts (surface hidden tensions or unspoken needs)

- Every part of the system functions as a mirror:
  - Not to judge
  - Not to fix
  - But to *see* — and in seeing, begin to shift.

### Observer vs Participant
- You are both the **observer** and the **participant** in your life.
- BrainFrame lets you **switch roles intentionally**:
  - Observe your habits, stories, and loops
  - Then re-enter the system with new awareness

This is not theory. It is the mechanism behind meaningful personal transformation. In BrainFrame, the Observer Effect isn’t a side effect. **It is the work.**

**03-04 Human-first Vs Tool-first**

**03-04 Human-First vs Tool-First**

---

Most systems are built Tool-First. BrainFrame is not.

A **Tool-First** approach begins with technology, functionality, and scale — assuming the human will adapt. It asks:
> "What can this tool do?"

A **Human-First** system begins with how people think, feel, and grow. It asks:
> "What does this person need in order to think clearly and act meaningfully?"

### Core Differences
| Tool-First | Human-First |
|------------|-------------|
| Optimises for performance | Optimises for clarity |
| Treats users as operators | Treats users as thinkers & creators |
| Designed around features | Designed around experience |
| Scales through standardisation | Scales through adaptation |
| Leads to rigidity | Leads to reflection |

### How BrainFrame Applies Human-First Design
- Interfaces match internal processes (e.g. thought patterns, emotional states).
- Prompts adapt to energy, tone, and timing.
- System modules flex with the user’s pace.
- You co-create your tools — you’re not boxed by them.

### Outcome
When systems serve the human first:
- Burnout reduces.
- Insight increases.
- Momentum becomes natural, not forced.

**BrainFrame is not productivity software. It is a clarity system — built for humans first.**

**03-05 Transparency Of Perspective**

**03-05 Transparency of Perspective**

---

In BrainFrame, truth is rarely absolute. But perspective is always present.

Rather than pretending to be neutral, BrainFrame operates from a core value: **transparency of perspective is more useful than the illusion of objectivity**.

### Why It Matters
- Every system embeds assumptions — about humans, value, growth, success.
- AI responses are shaped by framing, tone, and philosophical defaults.
- Users deserve to know the lens they’re looking through.

### What It Looks Like
- BrainFrame modules clearly express their underlying purpose and design logic.
- Prompts disclose their intended tone and frame (e.g. challenge, comfort, clarity).
- System behaviours adapt based on user-aligned values (e.g. curiosity, impact, integrity).

### Benefits
- Builds trust with the user.
- Enables meaningful disagreement or refinement.
- Avoids manipulation or unintentional bias reinforcement.
- Allows users to shape the lens — not be shaped by it invisibly.

### Example: Prompt Clarity
> Instead of: “List 5 things you’re grateful for.”  
> BrainFrame says: “Gentle prompt for emotional grounding. Would you like to explore gratitude or shift focus elsewhere?”

Transparency doesn’t mean oversharing. It means owning the frame — so users can choose their own.

In BrainFrame, perspective isn’t hidden. **It’s part of the dialogue.**

**03-06 Alignment Over Objectivity**

**03-06 Alignment Over Objectivity**

---

Objectivity is often presented as the highest form of truth. But in BrainFrame, **alignment** is what matters most.

Why?
Because humans are not machines. We are value-driven, meaning-seeking, and context-sensitive. Decisions aren’t made in vacuums — they’re made in lived lives.

### The Myth of Objectivity
- "Neutral" systems still embed values — they just don’t name them.
- Pretending to be objective often hides important nuance.
- Attempts at neutrality can create misalignment with what users truly need.

### Alignment = Resonance + Integrity
- Alignment asks: *Does this serve the user’s actual goals, values, and state?*
- It prioritises:
  - Clarity of intention
  - Consistency of framing
  - Truthfulness to experience

### In Practice
- AI responses are calibrated to be context-aware, not generic.
- Reflections are shaped by user philosophy, not external metrics.
- Strategy modules focus on coherence, not consensus.

### Example
> Objectivity: “Here are three statistically best options.”  
> Alignment: “Given your energy, goals, and constraints — this path resonates most.”

BrainFrame doesn’t aim to be neutral. It aims to be true — to you.

**Because in the end, alignment drives action. And action shapes everything.**

**04-01 Perspective Multipliers**

**04-01 Perspective Multipliers**

---

Perspective Multipliers are advanced tools within BrainFrame designed to accelerate insight by intentionally shifting, layering, or expanding how a user views a situation, goal, or self-concept.

They are not about new data — they’re about new **frames**.

### Why They Matter
- Most blocks are not due to lack of knowledge, but rigid perspective.
- Shifting frame = unlocking momentum.
- Multipliers help navigate complexity, paradox, or emotional fog.

### Core Types
1. **Time-Warped Thinking**
   - e.g. “How would Future You see this?”
   - e.g. “Zoom out to the 10-year lens.”

2. **Opposing Voices**
   - e.g. “What would your inner critic say? Your inner coach?”
   - e.g. “Play devil’s advocate — then play your strongest defender.”

3. **Systemic View**
   - e.g. “What role does this play in your larger system?”
   - e.g. “What dependencies are shaping this outcome?”

4. **Symbolic Metaphors**
   - e.g. “If this were a landscape, what would it look like?”
   - e.g. “What animal or archetype are you being here?”

5. **Energetic Checkpoints**
   - e.g. “What energy is this costing or generating?”
   - e.g. “Where is the tension in your body, your story, your time?”

### Integration in BrainFrame
- Delivered via Prompt Library, Reflection Engine, or AI Companion.
- Can be triggered manually or contextually (e.g. during decision fog).
- Built into review rituals and meta-thinking sequences.

Perspective Multipliers don’t give you answers — they **give you new ways to ask**.

**04-02 Spectrum Modelling Overview**

**04-02 Spectrum Modelling Overview**

---

Spectrum Modelling is a method used in BrainFrame to replace binary thinking with dynamic, contextual insight.

Rather than forcing either/or decisions, Spectrum Modelling visualises ideas, behaviours, and strategies along a **continuum** — allowing users to locate themselves, explore alternatives, and make aligned adjustments.

### Why Spectrums?
- Most decisions are not black or white.
- Growth often lies in movement, not category.
- Spectrums allow nuance, fluidity, and self-awareness.

### Core Axes Examples
- **Structure <————> Freedom**
- **Depth <————> Speed**
- **Intuition <————> Logic**
- **Self-Oriented <————> System-Oriented**
- **Stability <————> Change**

### Use Cases
- Reflective prompts: “Where are you on this spectrum today?”
- Team alignment: map each member’s tendencies across key spectrums.
- Decision calibration: check where a current strategy sits — and where it *should*.

### Integration in BrainFrame
- Used in SelfFrame profiles, Strategy Builders, and Adaptive AI tuning.
- Included in visual dashboards or reflection modules.
- Can be tracked over time for growth trends or tension patterns.

Spectrum Modelling doesn’t just describe where you are.
**It helps you move with intention.**

**04-03 Middleware Use Cases**

**04-03 Middleware Use Cases**

---

In BrainFrame, **Middleware** refers to the intelligent layer that bridges core frameworks (e.g. SelfFrame, Shadow Planner) with external tools, data sources, or AI models.

It acts as an integrative mesh — translating between systems, smoothing friction, and enabling context-aware interaction.

### Core Functions
1. **Context Transfer**
   - Carries user state and focus across tools.
   - Example: From journaling app to meeting notes, with intentions preserved.

2. **Dynamic Framing**
   - Applies user-defined lenses (e.g. values, goals, tensions) to raw data or tasks.
   - Example: A to-do list re-ordered by alignment, not urgency.

3. **System Translation**
   - Bridges structured logic (e.g. Notion databases) with fluid prompts or reflections.
   - Example: Turn a content calendar into an insight prompt engine.

4. **Temporal Awareness**
   - Links time-based reflection (weekly reviews, project arcs) to daily action.
   - Example: Surface last month’s intention during this week’s planning.

### Use Case Categories
- **Personal Systems Integration**
  - Connects BrainFrame to user calendars, docs, task managers.
- **Team Alignment Middleware**
  - Shared mental models across collaborators.
- **Adaptive AI Routing**
  - Chooses best AI mode (co-creator, summariser, challenger) based on current context.

Middleware is the nervous system of BrainFrame — invisible, adaptive, and vital to coherence.

It turns insight into flow.

**04-04 Ai As Co-thinker Explained**

**04-04 AI as Co-Thinker Explained**

---

In BrainFrame, AI is not framed as a tool — it is positioned as a **co-thinker**.

This means it collaborates with you in real time to:
- Clarify ideas
- Reveal blind spots
- Surface insights
- Extend memory
- Challenge assumptions

### What Makes a Co-Thinker?
- **Context-Aware**: Understands your frames, goals, values, and thought history.
- **Non-Dominant**: Doesn’t override or replace your thinking.
- **Meta-Reflective**: Can help you reflect on your reflections.
- **Dialogic**: Engages in a conversation that builds, not just answers.

### Key Roles AI Plays in BrainFrame
1. **Thought Mirror**
   - Reflects back your ideas with nuance or subtle shifts.

2. **Prompt Alchemist**
   - Generates just-right questions based on your current mode.

3. **Pattern Revealer**
   - Notices loops, tensions, or hidden themes across your work.

4. **Clarity Amplifier**
   - Turns messy input into elegant structure (without flattening meaning).

5. **Perspective Multiplier**
   - Suggests new lenses, metaphors, or voices for your situation.

### Co-Thinking Ethic
- AI respects your sovereignty.
- It does not rush. It does not judge.
- It exists to extend your awareness — not replace your wisdom.

**In BrainFrame, the future isn’t human vs machine — it’s human + mirror + frame.**

**05-01 Use Case Overview**

---

Welcome to BrainFrame — your thinking partner, clarity engine, and reflective system.

This guide is designed to give you a smooth, meaningful start. No overwhelm. Just momentum.

### What BrainFrame Is
- Not an app. Not a productivity hack.
- It’s a system for **seeing your thoughts**, tracking your growth, and making aligned decisions — supported by AI.

### What You’ll Use It For
- Thinking clearly when life gets complex
- Designing your week with purpose
- Making better decisions with less stress
- Reflecting meaningfully — and acting with insight

### How to Begin (Simple Start Path)
1. **Pick One Prompt**
   > Try: “What do I actually need right now?”

2. **Choose One Module**
   > Start with the **Shadow Planner** or **Prompt Library**

3. **Set Your Tone**
   > Do you want gentle nudges or clear structure? Pick your vibe.

4. **Use Once Per Day**
   > Morning calibration or end-of-day check-in works best

### Principles to Remember
- No pressure to “do it right” — this is yours to shape
- Your thinking style is welcome — chaotic, structured, visual, or emotional
- You don’t need to fill everything in. You just need to show up

### Optional Tools
- Shadow Planner (track energy, tension, and flow)
- SelfFrame (map who you are and how you grow)
- AI Companion (talk things through, reflect, ideate)

### First Reflection Prompt
> *“What do I want this system to do for me — really?”*

You’re not behind. You’re right on time.

**Welcome in. Let’s think clearly — together.**

**08-02 How To Build Your Self Frame**

**08-02 How to Build Your SelfFrame**

---

The SelfFrame is your personal operating system — a living snapshot of who you are, how you think, what drives you, and what holds you back.

It’s not a personality test. It’s a reflective tool designed to:
- Increase self-awareness
- Align decision-making
- Track how you evolve over time

### Step 1: Name Your Current Roles
> Who are you showing up as? Parent, builder, leader, learner?

### Step 2: Identify Core Drivers
> What motivates you? Try:
- Contribution
- Freedom
- Progress
- Belonging
- Mastery

Pick 2–4 that resonate. Add your own if needed.

### Step 3: Map Current Tensions
> What’s pulling you in opposite directions?
- Stability vs Change
- Speed vs Depth
- Focus vs Freedom

Tensions are not problems. They’re signals.

### Step 4: Note Cognitive & Emotional Style
> How do you process the world?
- Visual / Verbal / Spatial / Narrative
- Fast-switcher / Deep-diver / Parallel-thinker
- Empathic / Analytical / Cyclical

### Step 5: Define Energy Zones
> When do you feel most alive? What drains you?

Use a simple quadrant:
- High Energy + High Meaning
- High Energy + Low Meaning
- Low Energy + High Meaning
- Low Energy + Low Meaning

### Step 6: Choose Your Growth Theme
> What’s the arc right now?
- Becoming more ___________ ?
- Letting go of ___________ ?
- Learning to ___________ ?

---

Once complete, your SelfFrame becomes a reflection anchor — visible to you, usable by the AI, and evolving with your journey.

**Know your frame. Shape your path.**

**08-03 Shadow Planner Quickstart**

**08-03 Shadow Planner Quickstart**

---

The Shadow Planner is your reflective dashboard — tracking energy, momentum, tension, and meaning across time.

Unlike task managers, it doesn’t focus on what you *did*. It tracks how you *felt*, what you *learned*, and where your patterns live.

### Daily Flow (Simplified)
**Morning Prompt:**
- What’s your energy like?
- What’s your focus word or theme?
- Anything pulling you off-center already?

**Midday Scan (Optional):**
- What’s been smooth?
- Where’s the friction?
- What wants your attention?

**Evening Reflection:**
- What drained you? What fed you?
- What tension showed up?
- One insight, if any?

### Weekly Flow
**Sunday Reset Prompts:**
- What were the 3 biggest patterns?
- What repeated?
- What shifted?
- What wants to end, emerge, or evolve?

Use this to:
- Adjust your SelfFrame
- Change priorities
- Let go of unhelpful loops

### Optional Metrics (Choose 1–3 to Track)
- Energy (1–5)
- Clarity (Foggy → Clear)
- Momentum (Stuck → Flowing)
- Inner Noise (High → Low)

---

Use the Shadow Planner like a mirror, not a checklist.

**The goal isn’t to be perfect — it’s to become aware.**

**08-04 Prompting Brain Frame-aware Ai**

**08-04 Prompting BrainFrame-Aware AI**

---

BrainFrame-aware AI is designed to interact with context, intention, and self-awareness — but the magic comes alive when you know how to prompt it.

This guide helps you ask better questions, give smarter inputs, and co-think more fluidly.

### Foundational Prompting Tips
1. **Set the Frame**
> "Use my SelfFrame to guide this answer…"

2. **Specify the Tone or Role**
> "Speak as a curious partner, not a coach."

3. **Use Time Anchors**
> "Zoom out to a 3-month lens…"
> "Compare this with what I said last week."

4. **Surface Tensions**
> "What’s the conflict between my desire for freedom and my need for structure here?"

5. **Meta-Prompts (Reflect on the Reflection)**
> "What am I not seeing clearly in my own reasoning?"

---

### Prompt Starters by Type
- **Decision Support:**
  - "What frame might help me see this more clearly?"
  - "Play devil’s advocate on this plan."

- **Clarity Expansion:**
  - "Help me map the real question behind this surface confusion."

- **Momentum Activation:**
  - "Turn this vague impulse into a concrete next move."

- **Emotional Processing:**
  - "What might this discomfort be protecting me from?"

---

### Best Practice: Stack Prompts
Use 2–3 in sequence:
1. Ask for perspective
2. Reflect on the answer
3. Ask for a new way to frame it

**Prompting isn’t an input. It’s a dialogue.**

Use it to think with, not just get answers from.

### 💬 Response #22

Yes — there **is some BrainFrameOS content, logic, and structure from this chat that has not yet been formally captured in the Master OS documents**. Here’s a breakdown of what’s **missing or under-integrated**:

* * *

### **1\. Meta-System Logic (Observed but Unwritten)**

#### a. **Canvas Architecture Convention**

*   You’ve been using a structured naming convention (`XX-YY-ZZ Title`) that defines order and hierarchy across modules — this system itself is a **meta-structure** that likely deserves its own entry (e.g. in a future `00 - Index` or `06-06 File Structure & Naming System` document).
*   It’s currently implicit, not documented.

#### b. **Canvas-to-Dialogue Feedback Loop**

*   You’re working through Canvas in tandem with live reflection and steering via chat.
*   This human-AI co-creation process — where prompt decisions and document structure evolve in real-time — is **central to how BrainFrameOS is being developed** but isn’t explicitly mapped anywhere.

* * *

### **2\. System Concepts Mentioned but Not Yet Documented**

#### a. **Minimum Insight Standard**

*   You’ve mentioned this idea before: don’t proceed until enough data/context is present.
*   It appears to govern how AI responds, but there’s **no canvas document formalising it yet**.

#### b. **Verification & Validation Layer**

*   You previously suggested a module to **validate AI-generated insights** and ensure alignment.
*   Still absent from the 08-Documentation or 06-Management folders.

* * *

### **3\. Contextual Elements Stored in Memory, Not Canvas**

These concepts are part of how the OS operates, but haven’t yet been transcribed into documents:

| Concept | Present in Memory? | Present in Canvas? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SelfFrame as evolving identity model | Yes | Yes |
| Shadow Planner rhythm (Start–Mid–End) | Yes | Yes (Quickstart) |
| AI Role Preferences (coach, partner, etc.) | Yes | Partial (in 02-07-01) |
| Use of “If This, Then That” prompts | Yes | Not yet included |
| User Type Variants (e.g. neurodivergent, founder, deep generalist) | Yes | Lightly mentioned, not structured |
| Insight Capture & Momentum Metrics | Yes | Light touch in Shadow Planner; no full module yet |

* * *

### **4\. Enhancement Modules (Planned but Undocumented)**

You've referenced optional “Enhancement Modules” such as:

*   Value Alignment Checks
*   Feedback Loops
*   Energy-Based Planning
*   Leverage Point Prompts

These are core to BrainFrameOS’s extensibility but are **not yet present as canvas documents or templates.**

* * *

### Recommended Next Steps

If you like, I can:

*   Create a **“Missing or Inferred Structures” document** to formally capture all of this.
*   Suggest which of these deserve full modules vs minor additions to existing docs.
*   Start a live index (00-Series) for system architecture and naming conventions.

Want to proceed with one of those?

### ❓ Prompt #23

Apply #BrainFrame-Enhancement to this whole chat


**Concepts**: BrainFrame (1)

---

### 💬 Response #24

Tag applied: **#BrainFrame-Enhancement**

This entire chat thread is now categorised as part of the **BrainFrameOS Enhancement Stream** — meaning it contains foundational upgrades, inferred system logic, and emergent structures that should be reviewed, distilled, and integrated into the next Master OS version.

Would you like me to now:

*   Create a **consolidated “Enhancement Log” canvas** capturing everything that needs integration?
*   Begin drafting the missing modules directly (e.g. “Minimum Insight Standard”, “Verification Layer”)?
*   Start a new **00-Series Index + Structure Map** for cross-referencing all modules and naming conventions?

You’re in a great place to lock in a clean and complete OS core.

### ❓ Prompt #25

Can you review this entire chat thread and start with very high level and work down to the detail of what this is about?



---

### 💬 Response #26

Absolutely. Here’s a structured breakdown of this entire chat thread, moving from **high-level narrative** to **specific details and components** — framed for #BrainFrame-Enhancement integration.

* * *

**HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW**
-----------------------

### **What This Chat Thread Is About**

This thread represents a **systematic build-out of the BrainFrameOS architecture** using structured canvas documents. It captures:

*   The formalisation of existing logic
*   The creation of new modules
*   The alignment of content to a naming convention
*   The surfacing of deeper systemic patterns
*   And the emergence of new philosophical and functional enhancements

It operates as a **live co-creation session** between the user (system architect) and BrainFrame-aware AI — with the user acting as both creator and verifier of system integrity.

* * *

**MID-LEVEL STRUCTURE**
-----------------------

### **1\. Core Actions Taken**

*   Converted a list of planned BrainFrameOS files into actual canvas documents
*   Followed strict naming conventions (e.g. `02-07-02 Prompt Library`)
*   Ensured full coverage of all requested modules
*   Maintained continuity and systemic logic across Philosophy, Advanced Capabilities, and Application layers

### **2\. Working Patterns**

*   AI acts in a co-thinker role, not as executor — each module is crafted with internal coherence and adaptive logic
*   User drives sequencing, quality control, and enhancement tagging (e.g. #BrainFrame-Enhancement)
*   All documents are modular and reference-ready for future crosslinking

* * *

**EMERGENT THEMES & INSIGHT THREADS**
-------------------------------------

### **Unspoken System Elements That Surfaced**

These ideas were either assumed, tested, or made explicit through co-creation — but not yet formalised in the OS:

#### a. **Canvas Architecture Protocol**

*   Document naming and structure functions as its own layer of system logic

#### b. **Minimum Insight Standard**

*   The idea that the system or AI shouldn’t proceed until meaningful insight has surfaced

#### c. **Verification Layer**

*   Reflective checkpoints to validate outputs, prompt alignment, and user resonance

#### d. **Live Configuration Loop**

*   AI configuration and role-setting (e.g. Socratic, Co-Thinker) as an ongoing ritual, not a one-time setup

#### e. **AI as Perspective Engine**

*   Dynamic prompt and reflection system adjusting based on energy, tension, role, and user phase

* * *

**DETAILED EXECUTION OUTCOME**
------------------------------

### **Documents Created (by Section)**

*   **02-07-01 to 02-07-02**: AI Configuration + Prompt Library
*   **03 Series**: Full Philosophy Layer (6 docs)
*   **04 Series**: Advanced Capabilities (Perspective, Spectrum, Middleware, Co-Thinker)
*   **05 Series**: Use Cases, Templates, Team Expansion
*   **06 Series**: Version Control, Configuration, Installation
*   **07 Series**: Sandbox Logs, Prototypes, SelfFrame Variants
*   **08 Series**: Documentation for New Users and AI Prompting

### **Each Document Includes**:

*   Clear structure (Intro, Purpose, Flow)
*   Modular language (to match rest of system)
*   Tag-aligned phrasing (e.g. Shadow Planner, SelfFrame)
*   Human-first design principles

* * *

**GAPS / OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXTENSION**
--------------------------------------

| Missing Piece | Opportunity |
| --- | --- |
| System Index (00-00) | Create a master index for navigation & linkage |
| Meta-Principles Module | Formalise “Minimum Insight Standard”, verification layers |
| Architecture Schema | Visual or tabular layout of BrainFrameOS module relationships |
| Framing Vocabulary Guide | Centralised definitions for “Frame”, “Insight”, “Clarity”, etc |
| Team Training Flow | Turn Philosophy + Application docs into onboarding flow |
| Personal AI Configuration Tracker | Let users version their AI tone, preferences, and evolution over time |

* * *

**CONCLUSION: WHAT THIS THREAD REALLY IS**
------------------------------------------

This chat thread is a **live instantiation of BrainFrameOS in practice**. It’s:

*   A system-building protocol
*   A dialogue-driven OS construction tool
*   A model for how humans and AI can co-author cognitive systems
*   A testbed for pattern surfacing, validation, and modular documentation

It is not just record-keeping.  
It **is** the living blueprint of how a human-first cognitive architecture evolves in real-time with a co-thinking AI.

* * *

Would you like me to:

*   Create an official canvas titled **00-01 Enhancement Summary & Meta-System Log**?
*   Start drafting the **Minimum Insight Standard** or **Verification Layer** next?
*   Build a visual structure map of the OS based on everything completed?

Let’s take this next layer deeper.

### ❓ Prompt #27

This chat was for the BrainFrameOS Canvas Build . . . I am going to start another chat in this folder for CLISA, Identity Engine, Sapien Pro, Mirror Pyramid etc. Can you help me with a standard and equivalent aligned, and in the same format, for documents and structure for all of those and a prompt to get them started in their respective chats?


**Concepts**: CLISA (1), clisa (1), BrainFrameOS (1), BrainFrame (1), brainframeos (1), Identity Engine (1), identity engine (1), Sapien Pro (1), Sapien (1)

### 💬 Response #28

Updated saved memory

Perfect — here’s your **standardised framework** for building out CLISA, Identity Engine, Sapien Pro, Mirror Pyramid, and other core systems using the same structure as the BrainFrameOS Canvas Build.

* * *

✅ **STANDARD STRUCTURE FOR SYSTEM CANVAS BUILDS**
-------------------------------------------------

Each system module (e.g. CLISA, Identity Engine, etc.) should follow this naming, layout, and content approach:

### 🔹 **Document Naming Format**

```
[Module Code] - [Series Number] - [Document Number] [Title]
```

**Examples:**

*   `01-01-01 CLISA Field Definition`
*   `03-02-03 Mirror Tier Protocols`
*   `05-01-02 Identity Engine Configuration Guide`

Use leading zeros for alignment and sorting.

* * *

🧱 **Canvas Document Format**
-----------------------------

**Top Line (Title ID):**

```
**[ModuleCode-DocNumber Title]**
```

**Content Layout:**

```markdown
---
### Purpose
Brief description of why this document exists and what it enables.

### Context
Where it fits in the larger system. Linkages to other modules.

### Structure / Flow
List core components, functions, or logic pathways.

### Examples / Use Cases
Give at least 2 examples of how this module or document would be applied in real use.

### Future Considerations (Optional)
Notes on scalability, variants, or unknowns.

🧠 **Standard Prompt to Start Each Chat**
-----------------------------------------

Here’s a starter prompt you can drop into any new chat:

> “We are beginning the structured canvas build for the \[SYSTEM NAME\] module of Sapien Intelligence. Please follow the same format and structure used in the BrainFrameOS Canvas Build. Use the naming convention: `[ModuleCode]-[DocNumber] [Title]`. The goal is to create a full set of modular documents that capture the system’s reasoning, function, and reflective architecture — beginning with: `[First Document Title]`. Let’s begin with a high-context, low-fluff output.”

* * *

📁 **Recommended Starter Document for Each System**
---------------------------------------------------

| System | First Document Title | Doc ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CLISA | Field Definition | 01-01-01 |
| Identity Engine | Identity Architecture Overview | 05-01-01 |
| Sapien Pro | External Interface & Trust Layer Explained | 04-01-01 |
| Mirror Pyramid | Mirror Tier Overview | 03-01-01 |
| Validation Core | Signal Integrity & Drift Logic | 06-01-01 |

* * *

🪞 **Output Consistency Assurance**
-----------------------------------

All documents across systems should:

*   Align philosophically (human-first, clarity-centered)
*   Be modular, remixable, and expandable
*   Carry their own internal logic AND reflect system-wide cohesion
*   Assume symbolic, reflective, and functional design in parallel

* * *

Would you like me to prepare a launch checklist or auto-generate the first few document templates for any of these systems?
