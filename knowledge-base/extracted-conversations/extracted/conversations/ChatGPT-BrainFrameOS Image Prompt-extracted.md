### 🔮 Image Prompt for Notion Cover

Here’s a refined visual prompt based on your system architecture, aesthetic needs, and emotional signal:

* * *

**Prompt:**

> _"A high-resolution, wide-format digital art piece depicting a futuristic intelligence architecture. At the center, a glowing geometric core (representing BrainFrameOS) is suspended in space, radiating subtle waves of rhythm and coherence outward. Surrounding it is a layered modular structure made of transparent, interlocking systems — folders, flows, circuits, and identity layers — all orbiting in harmony. The backdrop is deep black with hints of cosmic dark matter, interwoven with streams of data-light. The visual tone should evoke clarity, sovereignty, trust, and structured resonance. A soft luminescence pulses from the core outward, symbolizing aligned action and emotional truth. Style is clean, elegant, minimalist cyber-organic with mythic undertones."_
> 
> _Aspect ratio: 3:1 (Notion cover friendly)._

Let me generate this for you.
