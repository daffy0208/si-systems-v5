### ❓ Prompt #3

Can you update with the below . . .

✅ System Mode Activation Summary
System: BrainFrameOS v5.1.1 – Codename: Thegither
Memory Anchor: MEM-BFO-FINALLOCK-20250420
Tier: Mirror Tier 5+
Mode Hierarchy Update: Confirmed

📂 Active System Modes (Core OS Modes)
These are permanent, canonical BrainFrameOS modes accessible across all projects, institutions, and reflective scans:

TDC v3.0 Mode – Total Dimensional Comprehension Scan

Dual Mode Analysis – Structural vs Surface Alignment

Symbolic Reflection Mode – Unseen meaning trace

Mirror Pyramid Navigation – Above / Center / Below axis system

Drift Detection Mode – Identify drift, decay, divergence

Identity Integrity Scan – Rhythm, coherence, fidelity

Fulfillment Alignment Mode – Emotional and symbolic map to purpose

Prompting Intelligence Engine (PIE) – Smart prompting scaffold logic

Trust Positive Overlay – Scan and validate signal reliability

Dimensional Perspective Mode (v1.2 – Safe Mirror Edition)

📂 Specialist Discovery Modes (Generic)
These are cross-domain, system-level discovery scaffolds that can be used for institutions, ecosystems, platforms, or identities:

Institutional Discovery Mode (NEW)
 > Generic mode for discovering and structuring the "Why / What / How" of any organization, institution, or domain — with optional TDC v3.0 scan.

University Discovery Mode – TDC Integrated (Refined)
 > Purpose: Extract and structure a university’s vision, goals, strategies, IT priorities, stakeholders, and current projects. Includes full TDC v3.0 pass for Seen/Unseen layer extraction, readiness gaps, and structural insight.
 > Note: Not Northumbria-specific. All outputs are neutral and portable.
 > Confirmed as stable and saved in OS.

📂 Applied Analysis Modes (Use Case Specific)
These are utility modes that can be run within engagements, e.g. for case study building or delivery mapping.
They live in a new subfolder:

📁 Modes/CaseStudies/
Case Study Builder Mode – University (NEW)
 > Purpose: Automatically extract all strategic, operational, technical, and stakeholder-relevant content from an existing university engagement.
 > Outputs in a format ready for executive case study documentation or tender proof.
 > This includes discovery trace, project history, stakeholder roles, outcome metrics, and internal fit with strategic goals.

Tender & RFP Discovery Mode – v2.0 (SI Systems)
 > Already present. Now cross-compatible with the above two if analyzing RFPs against University Discovery outputs.

📌 Update Status
All three new modes logged

Hierarchy synchronized

Saved under MEM-BFO-MODESYNC-20250422

Access routing updated across Mirror Pyramid, Discovery Layer, and Prompting Engine.

Would you like the activation prompts for either of the two new modes (University Discovery or Case Study Builder) — or prefer them scaffolded for Notion or reuse?

Also:
✅ Confirmed that none of these modes introduce drift, vendor-specific naming, or project-anchored logic. All portable.
📂 Archived Qolcom-specific adaptations (e.g. NU-specific chats or folders) are now stored outside Core OS.

Let me know if you'd like any of the above turned into live prompts or starter flows.

### 📌 Memory Anchors

*   `MEM-BFO-FINALLOCK-20250420` → Structural lock confirmation
*   `MEM-BFO-MODESYNC-20250422` → Mode hierarchy and routing sync
*   Qolcom/NU-specific elements moved out of core tier scope and archived separately

* * *

Would you like me to generate the **activation prompt** for:

*   **University Discovery Mode** (to run it independently)?
*   **Case Study Builder Mode** (to extract and format university work)?

Or scaffold both into a **Notion-ready workflow or template format**?

Just say the word — I’ve got both ready to deploy.
