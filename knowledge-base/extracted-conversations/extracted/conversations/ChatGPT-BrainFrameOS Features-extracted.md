### ❓ Prompt #1

qhat is the latest os and features



---

### 💬 Response #2

The latest version of BrainFrameOS is **v2.0**, which has been fully locked and finalized. It includes the following core features and modules:

1.  **Identity Engine**:
    *   A dynamic framework to align the user's identity with the system.
    *   Features include the Drift vs Identity Displacement Detector (to detect if the user is misaligned or stressed) and the Guest Mode (to accommodate external users without disrupting the core identity).
2.  **Drift Detection & Feedback**:
    *   Continuous monitoring for inconsistencies in user behavior or system alignment.
    *   Prompts for reflection when drift is detected, ensuring the user remains connected to their core identity.
3.  **START\_HERE.txt**:
    *   A cold-start activation guide that is tailored to the user's personality profile and cognitive style.
    *   Includes prompts to begin with self-discovery or reflection rather than work-driven tasks.
4.  **Pulse Dashboard**:
    *   A visual rhythm tracker for energy calibration, providing real-time insight into the user’s cognitive and emotional state.
    *   Designed to track and balance input vs output harmony, ensuring a smooth workflow and rhythm alignment.
5.  **Insight Engine**:
    *   Facilitates structured insight capture, reflection prompts, and timeline mapping to help users track long-term evolution and self-reflection.
6.  **Shadow Planner**:
    *   A task management and intention-setting module, designed to gently support planning without overwhelming the user.
    *   Energy-aware task flow to align activities with the user’s cognitive and emotional state.
7.  **Output Harmony Check**:
    *   A system validation tool to ensure that AI-generated content matches the depth, energy, and intent of user input.
8.  **Full Identity Calibration**:
    *   Supports inputs from personality systems like MBTI, DISC, VIA, and values, which are used to inform the system’s adjustments and tailoring.
9.  **Protection & IP Layer**:
    *   Includes a lightweight IP protection system and clear licensing instructions.
    *   All core modules are locked into the system for stability and security, while future enhancements are planned.
10.  **Core Writing Standard**:
    *   System documentation and user-facing content now follow a clear, grounded, and structured tone, eliminating spiritual or poetic language. The writing standard ensures consistency in communication and clarity.

These features work together to create an operating system focused on human-centered growth, rhythm alignment, and personalized identity evolution.

Let me know if you'd like further details on any of these features!
