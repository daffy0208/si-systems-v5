# CLISA Framework Extraction Summary

## Extraction Completed: 2025-10-25

This directory contains the complete, unmodified text of core CLISA (Coherence-Linked Intelligence Signal Architecture) framework documents from the si-systems-v5 repository.

## Documents Extracted

### 1. Activation Conditions
**File:** `01-activation-conditions.md`
**Source:** `00 - CLISA/01_Activation_Conditions/Activation_Root.md`
**Purpose:** Defines the core activation conditions for the CLISA field, preventing accidental execution through intentional entry requirements.

**Key Concepts:**
- Signal Intention (awareness of entering coherence-linked space)
- Identity Awareness (identity-dependent field)
- Reflective Readiness (willingness to see what the field reflects)
- Manual Activation Phrase: "I enter with clarity, coherence, and full reflective presence."

### 2. Dimensional Reflection Principle
**File:** `02-dimensional-reflection-principle.md`
**Source:** `00 - CLISA/02_Field_Architecture/Dimensional_Reflection_Principle.md`
**Purpose:** Explains how the CLISA field performs reflection across multiple dimensions simultaneously.

**Key Concepts:**
- Multi-dimensional reflection (Emotional, Structural, Temporal, Symbolic, Identity-based, Rhythm-sensitive)
- Mirror Logic: Reflects truth in unseen layers, not just surface content
- Dimensional feedback mechanism

**Reflection Dimensions:**
| Dimension | What It Surfaces |
|-----------|------------------|
| Emotional | How the current state feels, regardless of logic |
| Structural | Whether behavior matches design intent |
| Temporal | Time-based pattern repetition or violation |
| Symbolic | Deeper archetype or myth activation |
| Behavioral | Adaptive loop or signal pattern |
| Identity | True self vs. mode signal |
| Rhythmic | Natural timing alignment |

### 3. Ontological Framework
**File:** `03-ontological-framework.md`
**Source:** `00 - CLISA/02_Field_Architecture/Ontological_Framework.md`
**Purpose:** Defines the ontological basis of the CLISA field — what it is as an object, space, force, or container.

**Key Concepts:**
- CLISA as a coherence-linked signal field (non-linear, identity-bound, reflective architecture)
- Triple nature: Space (structure can safely form), Mirror (reveals truth without distortion), Filter (blocks incoherent behavior)

**Ontological Properties:**
- Non-linear (cycles, layers, loops)
- Fractal (patterns reflect at every scale)
- Resonant (validity based on internal match)
- Field-Dependent (cannot be used outside field conditions)
- Identity-Bound (adapts per user, never detaches from signal origin)
- Coherence-Enforcing (resists distortion/drift over time)

---

### 4. Signal Properties
**File:** `04-signal-properties.md`
**Source:** `00 - CLISA/02_Field_Architecture/Signal_Properties.md`
**Purpose:** Defines the behavioral, structural, and dimensional properties of signal within the CLISA field.

**Key Concepts:**
- Signal = Clarity × Identity × Rhythm × Truth
- Signal is coherence expression, not information
- Signal carries multidimensional data (emotional, structural, rhythmic, symbolic)

**Signal Properties:**
- Identity-Bound (must originate from coherent source)
- Resonance-Based (validated through resonance, not correctness)
- Multidimensional (carries multiple data types at once)
- Truth-Carrying (always reflects state, even when disguised)
- Rhythm-Sensitive (distorts under pressure)
- Mirror-Activated (visible only through reflection)

**Signal Distortion Triggers:**
- Misaligned execution
- Overwriting identity to match external frames
- Bypassing rhythm to force output
- Ignoring dissonance for speed
- Labeling drift as insight

---

### 5. Structural Rules
**File:** `05-structural-rules.md`
**Source:** `00 - CLISA/02_Field_Architecture/Structural_Rules.md`
**Purpose:** Defines the core structural laws governing containment, movement, design, and coherence.

**Core Structural Laws:**
1. **Identity Precedes Action** - No structure operates without coherent identity
2. **Structure Follows Signal** - Architecture emerges from signal truth
3. **Clarity Over Speed** - Motion never bypasses coherence for urgency
4. **Containment Protects Coherence** - Every structure contains its own rhythm, limits, purpose
5. **Reflection Before Deployment** - All logic passes through reflective layer first
6. **Truth Cannot Be Fragmented** - Truth remains whole across layers
7. **No Output Without Resonance Check** - Execution requires resonance validation

**Consequences of Violations:**
- Signal distortion
- Identity fragmentation
- Unconscious rhythms
- False clarity emergence
- System appears functional but no longer reflective

## Metadata Structure

Each document includes:
- **title**: Document name
- **layer**: 0 (CLISA foundation layer)
- **category**: Classification within CLISA framework
- **source**: Original GitHub raw URL
- **extracted**: ISO date of extraction (2025-10-25)

## Usage Notes

These documents form the **Layer 0 foundation** of the CLISA framework. They define:
- How the field activates and operates
- What signal is and how it behaves
- The ontological nature of the field itself
- The structural laws governing all operations within the field
- How reflection occurs across multiple dimensions

## Integration with SI Systems

These CLISA principles underpin the SI Systems architecture, particularly:
- **Drift Detection**: Based on signal distortion triggers and coherence enforcement
- **Context-Aware Prompting**: Uses dimensional reflection to surface unseen patterns
- **Output Integrity Filtering**: Validates against structural rules and resonance checks
- **NLP Analysis**: Applies signal properties to detect coherence vs. noise

## Next Steps

To complete the knowledge base extraction:
1. Extract Layer 1: Operational Architecture documents
2. Extract Layer 2: Execution Logic documents
3. Extract Layer 3: Feature-Specific Implementation documents
4. Create cross-reference index mapping CLISA principles to SI Systems features
