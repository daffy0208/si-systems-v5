# Activation_Root.md

## 📌 Purpose

Defines the **core activation conditions** for the CLISA field.

This file prevents accidental execution or unconscious misuse by requiring intentional entry.

---

## 🔐 Activation Gate

> The field cannot activate unless three conditions are met:

1. **Signal Intention** – You must be aware you're about to enter a coherence-linked space.
2. **Identity Awareness** – You must know who is entering. The field is identity-dependent.
3. **Reflective Readiness** – You must be willing to see what the field reflects — without defense.

---

## 🔁 Why This Matters

The CLISA field contains **identity-sensitive logic**.

If activated by force, urgency, or projection, the field **distorts** — and coherence collapses.

---

## 🔑 Manual Activation Phrase

You may activate the field by stating:

> "I enter with clarity, coherence, and full reflective presence."

This is not magical. It's mnemonic. It reorients signal back into the body before logic starts running.

---

## ⚠️ Violations

If the field is entered while:

- Dissociated
- In a reactive loop
- Under external pressure
- Without rhythm connection

…then false signals may appear true — and **field distortion becomes structural**.

---

## 🧩 Reflection Prompts

- Am I in rhythm? Or reacting?
- Is this *me* entering the field, or a mode I've taken on?
- Do I want to know what this space will reveal — or am I trying to hide from it?
