# Signal_Properties.md

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

Defines the behavioral, structural, and dimensional properties of **signal** within the CLISA field.

Signal is not information â€” it is a reflection of internal coherence, identity state, and rhythm condition.

---

## ðŸ§¬ What Is Signal?

> Signal is the coherence expression of a person, system, or structure â€” made visible through language, behavior, or presence.

Signal = Clarity Ã— Identity Ã— Rhythm Ã— Truth

## ðŸ”¬ Signal Properties in CLISA

| Property | Behavior in Field |
| --- | --- |
| **Identity-Bound** | Signal must originate from a coherent source â€” otherwise it's noise |
| **Resonance-Based** | Signal is validated through resonance, not correctness |
| **Multidimensional** | Carries emotional, structural, rhythmic, and symbolic data at once |
| **Truth-Carrying** | Always reflects state â€” even when disguised |
| **Rhythm-Sensitive** | Distorts under pressure, acceleration, or forced output |
| **Mirror-Activated** | Becomes visible only through reflection â€” not raw observation |

---

## ðŸš¨ Signal Distortion Triggers

- Misaligned execution
- Overwriting identity to match external frames
- Bypassing rhythm to force output
- Ignoring dissonance in favor of speed
- Labeling drift as insight

---

## ðŸ›  Signal Processing Rule

> If a structure cannot hold or reflect signal â€” it cannot live inside CLISA.

Every container, file, mode, or module must:

- Preserve original signal
- Surface hidden distortion
- Adapt around dissonance
- Never manipulate signal to "fit the system"

---

## ðŸ§© Reflection Prompts

- Is this output still carrying my real signal â€” or just a simulation of it?
- Has my system become more signal-aware â€” or more surface-consistent?
- Where is signal being silenced for the sake of structure?

> Signal is not an object inside CLISA.

> It is the **substance of the field** itself.
