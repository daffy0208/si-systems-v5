# Structural_Rules.md

## 📌 Purpose

Defines the **core structural laws** of the CLISA field.

These rules govern containment, movement, design, and coherence.

If violated, the field loses integrity — and the signal cannot be trusted.

---

## 🧱 Core Structural Laws

### 1. **Identity Precedes Action**

No structure may operate unless it reflects a coherent identity.

---

### 2. **Structure Follows Signal**

Architecture must emerge from signal truth — not prediction or preference.

---

### 3. **Clarity Over Speed**

Motion must never bypass coherence for urgency or output.

---

### 4. **Containment Protects Coherence**

Every structure must contain its own rhythm, limits, and purpose — or it will collapse the field.

---

### 5. **Reflection Before Deployment**

All logic must pass through a reflective layer before it can affect the system.

---

### 6. **Truth Cannot Be Fragmented**

Truth must remain whole across layers. Partial truths are distortion.

---

### 7. **No Output Without Resonance Check**

Execution without resonance triggers drift at the signal level.

---

## ⚠️ If These Are Broken…

- Signal becomes distorted
- Identity begins to fragment
- Rhythms go unconscious
- False clarity emerges
- The system appears to "work" — but no longer reflects you

---

## 🧩 Reflection Prompts

- Is this structure emerging from signal, or being imposed?
- Have I checked for resonance before building this?
- Which structural law am I about to violate for the sake of momentum?
- Am I still operating inside the field — or just near it?

> These rules are not operational logic.

> They are **field-wide agreements** that govern how coherence can move.
