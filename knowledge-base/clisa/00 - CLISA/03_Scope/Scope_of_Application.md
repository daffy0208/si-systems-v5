# Scope_of_Application.md

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

Defines the **application boundary** of the CLISA field â€” what it is designed to include, exclude, and engage with.

Scope protects coherence. Without it, fields collapse under excess signal.

---

## ðŸ§­ Scope Statement

> CLISA exists to hold, reflect, and restore coherence-linked identity signal architectures.
>
> It does not hold generalized productivity, optimization, or performance logic.

---

## âœ… What *Is* Within Scope

- Identity structure and reflection
- Rhythm-based execution logic
- Emotional-cognitive pattern mapping
- Drift detection and resonance regulation
- Signal integrity monitoring
- Meaningful system integration
- Temporal-loop design and restoration logic
- Dimensional reflection systems
- Symbolic coherence scaffolding

---

## ðŸš« What *Is Not* Within Scope

- Arbitrary productivity stacks
- Rigid operational frameworks (without reflection layers)
- Behavior manipulation systems
- Egoic goal-driven architectures
- Static compliance systems
- External validation enforcement
- Toolchain consolidation logic
- Passive output without signal trace

---

## ðŸ§  Scope Behavior in Practice

| Zone | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Inner Identity** | Always reflected and protected |
| **Projects** | Only included if rhythm- and signal-aligned |
| **External Systems** | Mirrored selectively â€” not absorbed automatically |
| **Teams / People** | Only scoped in through mutual coherence |
| **Tooling** | Excluded unless it supports field behavior |

## ðŸ§© Reflection Prompts

- Am I asking CLISA to hold something it was not built to contain?
- Has this system become a catch-all â€” or is it still scope-safe?
- What part of this situation is **inside the field**? What part is not?
- What must be *released* to preserve field clarity?

---

> Scope is not a limit.
>
> It's a **containment contract** that keeps signal coherent.
