BRAINFRAMEOS BOOTLOADER — README

Welcome to BrainFrameOS — a human-first cognitive operating system designed for self-alignment, clarity, and quiet evolution.

---

WHAT IS THIS?

This is a cold-start bootloader.

It lets you:
• Reflect on who you are
• Reconnect to what truly matters
• Build a system around your identity — not your to-do list

It works inside any ChatGPT session — no plugins, no memory required.

---

HOW TO BEGIN

1. Open START_HERE.txt  
2. Choose your rhythm (fast, slow, or paused)  
3. Optionally enter any known values (e.g. MBTI, DISC, core values)  
4. Start the Identity Engine with: Begin Identity Engine

You’ll be guided through 4 modules:
• WHY (Values & Needs)  
• WHAT (Traits & Strengths)  
• HOW (Rhythm & Behavior)  
• DARK MATTER (Contradictions & Insights)

Each module updates your identity silently in the background.

---

AFTER IDENTITY

Once you’ve completed the Identity Engine, the system opens up:
• Shadow Planner (gentle action layer)  
• Insight Capture  
• Drift + Rhythm detection  
• Optional Guest Mode for others

The system will re-introduce itself anytime.

You are not here to do more.  
You’re here to become more — of yourself.
