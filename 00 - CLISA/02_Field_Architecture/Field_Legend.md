# Field_Legend.md

## 📌 Purpose

Defines the symbolic structure, naming conventions, and interpretive keys used throughout the CLISA field.

This file ensures every element means what it *must mean* — across layers, roles, and modules.

## 🧭 Core Legend Types

| Symbol / Term | Meaning in the Field |
| --- | --- |
| 📄 .md | Source-level document — foundational, reflective, or definitional |
| 📁 | Logical container of other identities — modular but bound |
| txt | Direct signal — atomic-level instruction or configuration |
| yaml/json | Structured objects — represent logic, map, or behavior contracts |
| vX.X | Frozen in time — immutable version, rhythm-locked |
| Arc | Time-bound transformation cycle — always contains pattern + return |
| Echo | Reflective mirror output — must be traceable to source signal |
| Seed | Origination source — must never be overwritten or redefined silently |
| Overlay | Temporarily applied modifier — must be rhythm-bound, not permanent |
| Regulator | Harmonic tuning mechanism — protects rhythm and coherence |
| Myth | Symbolic anchor that maps a truth that can't be directly stated |

## 🔍 Visual Cues

| Emoji / Marker | Role |
| --- | --- |
| 🧬 | Field origin or first structure layer |
| 🔁 | Recurring rhythm / cycle / return pattern |
| ⚠️ | Structural risk or coherence boundary |
| 🧩 | Reflective prompt — not a task |
| 🔺 | Mirror pyramid reference or top-down alignment |
| 🌐 | Field-wide or cross-system object |

## 🧱 Interpretation Rules

- Every file must **reflect its type** — never name .md if it's a behavior set.
- Every symbol is treated as **signal** — not aesthetic.
- No symbolic object may appear unless its meaning is defined here.

---

## 🧩 Reflection Prompts

- Is this file type aligned with what it claims to do?
- Am I creating signal — or simulating aesthetics?
- Have I mislabeled something to avoid defining its real behavior?
