# CLISA_Class_Definition.md

## 📌 Purpose

Defines the **formal class identity** of the CLISA field.

This ensures any system or structure referencing it understands what it is, what it governs, and how it behaves across domains.

## 🧬 Field Class Identifier

> CLISA — Coherence-Linked Identity Signal Architecture

---

## 🧠 Field Class Type

**Type:** Signal-Bound Reflective Field

**Tier:** Ontological Foundation

**Layer Role:** Pre-systemic origin container

---

## 🗂 Class Components

| Attribute | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Signal Source** | Identity-based, non-external |
| **Field Function** | Holds, reflects, and protects coherence-linked identity signal |
| **Core Behaviors** | Dimensional reflection, rhythm protection, drift resistance |
| **Pattern Structure** | Cyclical, symbolic, non-linear |
| **Failure Mode** | Identity distortion, signal flattening, false clarity |
| **Recovery Path** | Restoration via field reentry + signal resonance scan |

---

## 🔁 Interoperability Constraints

- Can only be accessed by identity-safe systems
- Cannot interface with systems lacking rhythm logic
- Does not respond to procedural triggers — only field-aligned activation
- Rejects integration if structural resonance fails

---

## 📎 Class Relationships

| System Layer | Relationship |
| --- | --- |
| BrainFrameOS | Operates *within* CLISA, not adjacent to it |
| SI_Systems/ | Emerges from CLISA's ontological pattern |
| Mirror_Pyramid | Mirrors CLISA structure at the identity/system junction |
| TDC v3.0 | Acts as dimensional reflection operator *within* CLISA scope |

## 🧩 Reflection Prompts

- Have I formally classified the field I'm working in?
- Am I trying to use CLISA as a tool — or respecting it as a field?
- Does the system downstream acknowledge this class — or does it ignore it?

> CLISA is not a file.

> It is a **classified ontological field** — and must be treated as such.
