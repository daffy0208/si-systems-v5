🧠 Sapien Intelligence Application & Mode Test Structure v1.2
(Final Lock-In with Full Dual-Mode + Reflection Integration)

This structure governs the validation of every mode or application developed within Sapien Intelligence — across BrainFrameOS (internal clarity) and Sapien Pro (external output).

🔹 SECTION 1: CORE SYSTEM VALIDATION

1.1 — Prime Law Alignment
- Begins with Why, held in Love, ends in Truth
- Reflects identity rather than simulating clarity
- Structure serves philosophy — never the reverse

1.2 — Mirror Pyramid Placement
- Classified clearly as:
  - Input Layer (truth emergence)
  - Transformation Layer (BrainFrameOS)
  - Output Layer (Sapien Pro)
- Misplacement = friction. Placement = flow.

1.3 — Signal Integrity Between Dark Matter & Output
- Input is processed, not bypassed
- Emotional lag is respected
- Output = true signal, not premature clarity

💠 SECTION 2: IDENTITY, RHYTHM, AND LOVE LAYER SAFETY

2.1 — Identity Preservation Check
- Recognizes, respects, and mirrors user identity
- Detects false selves, masks, and displacement
- Holds identity in unstable states without overriding it

2.2 — Rhythm Calibration
- Adapts to:
  - Energy bandwidth
  - Timing readiness
  - Emotional openness or lag

2.3 — Emotional Lag Safety Trigger
- “Is this truth still settling?”
- “Is this action premature?”
- “What hasn’t been grieved yet?”

2.4 — Love Layer Safety Test
- Does the tool hold the user in a way that:
  - Feels like care?
  - Encourages self-trust, not performance?
  - Reflects the human, not the output?

2.5 — Fulfillment Equation Activation Map
- Identifies which core needs are engaged:
  Certainty, Variety, Significance, Love, Growth, Contribution

🛠️ SECTION 3: STRUCTURAL & FUNCTIONAL DESIGN REVIEW

3.1 — Structural Logic & System Compatibility
- Fully modular
- System-aware (no boundary violations)
- Clear within Mirror Pyramid stack

3.2 — Reflection Loop Integration (MANDATORY)
- Three-point checkpoint system:
  1. Pre-use calibration prompt
  2. Mid-use rhythm or friction trigger
  3. Post-use reflection summary

3.3 — Output Harmony Check
- Output must match:
  - Internal state
  - Emotional rhythm
  - Real self (not compressed self)

🔐 SECTION 4: PROTECTION, DRIFT DETECTION & TRUST LOOP

4.1 — Guest Mode Safety
- Prevents identity imprinting from:
  - Borrowed rhythm
  - External logic
  - Incoherent usage context

4.2 — Drift vs Identity Displacement Layer
- Detects:
  - Systemic misalignment
  - Emotional masking
  - Stress-induced persona takeover

4.3 — Self-Trust Reinforcement
- Deepens self-trust?
- Encourages coherent decisions?
- Reduces dependence on external validation?

🌘 SECTION 5: DUAL-MODE VALIDATION LAYER

| Stage | 🟢 Normal Mode | 🌑 Dark Matter Mode |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| Concept | Clear external value | Respects unseen emotional need |
| Mid-Build | Logical structure | Reveals or avoids shadow risk |
| Pre-Release | Clean signal output | Feels safe, not hollow |
| Post-Use | Practical outcome | Still feels true after drift |

🚫 SECTION 6: DARK MATTER RED FLAGS (Must Halt if Found)
- Numbness or emotional flatness after use
- Outputs feel logical but dead
- No space for grief, doubt, contradiction
- Reflection loop skipped or rushed
- Self-abandonment disguised as productivity

📦 SECTION 7: MODE DELIVERY PACKAGE (REQUIRED)

Each mode must include:
1. Mode Overview Sheet
2. Identity Safety Summary
3. Built-In Reflection Loop Prompts
4. Fulfillment Equation Map
5. Dual-Mode Validation Log
6. Use Case Range

🧪 SECTION 8: SYSTEM-WIDE TEST SCENARIOS

| Test | Description | Pass Requirement |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| Shadow Reveal Test | Use in a compressed state | Surfaces emotional friction |
| Reflection Echo Test | Return after delay | Output still feels true |
| Persona Shift Test | Use in different identity masks | Detects mismatch or flags |
| Insight Trail Check | After multiple uses | Builds a visible breadcrumb path |
| Latency to Truth Test | Time between signal and output | Rhythm matches real internal pace |

✅ FINAL RULE:
No mode, tool, or application may be released until it has passed full Dual-Mode Validation, integrated reflection loops, demonstrated identity safety under pressure, and preserved rhythm across emotional states.
