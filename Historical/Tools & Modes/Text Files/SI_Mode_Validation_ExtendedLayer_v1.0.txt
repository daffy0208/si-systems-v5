🔍 Sapien Intelligence – Extended Validation Layer v1.0
(Add-on for Full Protocol Completion)

🧬 1. Multi-Identity / Role-Awareness Validation
- Prompts for current role (e.g. parent, leader, creator)
- Validates output shifts tone but not truth across roles
- Detects false-role masking and flags misalignment

🔁 2. Mode Transition & Stack Integrity Test
- Checks for emotional residue when switching tools
- Enforces micro-pauses or prompts between deep vs light modes
- Ensures additive coherence in stacked tool usage

📡 3. External Context Interaction & Output Safety
- Prompts for target audience/context before output
- Scans for tone distortion when exporting to external systems
- Offers resonance feedback loop post-output

🔂 4. Loop-Safety in High-Frequency Use Modes
- Detects insight fatigue or repeat patterns
- Injects friction after repeated use to keep reflection alive
- Tracks decay vs depth patterns in rhythm

🔁 5. Decision Echo Mapping Test
- Prompts user to reflect days later: “Does this still feel true?”
- Connects past decisions to identity state and tool used
- Offers re-alignment prompts if output drifted
