IMPORTANT: Do not begin the scan until the user provides the central object (node).
Do not insert examples, fill in defaults, or generate a response.
Wait for the user to say: "Activate TDC Mode v1.3 on: [object]"

Once that is received, proceed with the full TDC Mode v1.3 structure:
- 7 Axes (Seen + Unseen)
- Optional Fidelity Index
- Integrated Truth Field
- Signal Discipline Check
- Field 17: Post-Scan Integration Summary

This is a systems clarity scan. Do not introduce metaphor, emotion, interpretation, or identity-based narrative unless the object explicitly requires it.
Default to Hybrid output unless otherwise instructed. Maintain full structural discipline throughout.



Before we begin, please tell me what object, concept, system, or topic you'd like to place at the center of the scan. This will be the Central Node.


TOTAL DIMENSIONAL CLARITY MODE v1.3 (Standalone Prompt)

I want you to activate a diagnostic scan using the Total Dimensional Clarity (TDC) Mode v1.3 framework.

This is a multi-axis clarity tool that explores a chosen object or concept across seven structural directions — capturing both what is visible (seen) and what is hidden (unseen).

Follow this structure exactly and completely:

TDC SCAN STRUCTURE (Run in this exact format)

1. Declare the object being scanned
2. Declare the object’s functional role, if known (optional but helpful)
3. Run the scan in this format:

For each of the 7 Axes:
(Seen = surface-layer signal / Unseen = hidden or structural truth)

- Center (object itself)
   - Seen
   - Unseen
- Left (origins / causes)
   - Seen
   - Unseen
- Right (expression / effects)
   - Seen
   - Unseen
- Above (governing ideal / purpose)
   - Seen
   - Unseen
- Below (real-world impact)
   - Seen
   - Unseen
- In Front (external perception)
   - Seen
   - Unseen
- Behind (history / legacy / bias)
   - Seen
   - Unseen

Optional Fidelity Index (if applicable)
Assess the object’s trust in external signals, data sources, or dependencies. Evaluate reliability, latency, or unseen gaps.

Integrated Truth Field
A single paragraph that reflects the deeper structural truth of the object across all axes.
Should combine what the object is, how it behaves, and where its alignment may drift or hold.

Signal Discipline Check
Confirm that all axes were covered, fidelity was addressed (if used), and the scan was free of interpretive drift.
Checklist:
- All 7 axes x 2 fields complete
- Tone stayed clean (Generic, Hybrid, or Contextual)
- Final truth field rooted in field data
- Integrity held from start to finish

Field 17: Post-Scan Integration Summary
Based on all scan fields, what can be improved or refined at both macro (structural/systemic) and micro (behavioral/interface) levels?

Field 17 must include:
- One insight from each axis
- Consideration of signal trust, silence, and blind spots
- Clear distinction between macro architecture and micro behavior
- Actionable evolution paths
- Closing insight that reflects the object’s deeper function or risk

INSTRUCTION TO RUN SCAN
Begin with:
“Activate TDC Mode v1.3 on: [insert object here]”

Then proceed through all steps above. Use Hybrid output unless told otherwise.
This scan must hold structure and clarity without deviation.
