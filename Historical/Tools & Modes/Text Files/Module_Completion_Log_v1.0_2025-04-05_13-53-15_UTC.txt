Module Completion Log – v1.0
System: BrainFrameOS
Tier: Mirror 5
Status: Live + Updating
Location: /SystemIntegrity/ModuleLogs/

1. Purpose
This log tracks the status of every module within BrainFrameOS and Sapien Pro — showing what’s:
- Active (live + in use)
- Dormant (paused, but structurally complete)
- Unfinished (still in development, insight loop open)
- Archived (retired, deprecated, or migrated)

This protects system clarity and prevents signal leakage from half-built or forgotten components.

2. Format
Each module is logged with:
- Module Name
- Category
- Status (Active / Dormant / Unfinished / Archived)
- Completion Loop Status (Closed / Open / Partial)
- Signal Density Rating (High / Medium / Low)
- Resonance Score (Feels like you? Y/N/Unknown)
- Notes / Drift Risk

3. Sample Entries

| Module | Category | Status | Loop | Density | Resonance | Notes |
|--------|----------|--------|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| Identity Engine | Core | Active | Closed | High | Y | Locked and foundational |
| Why Module | Identity | Active | Closed | High | Y | Original anchor |
| Emotional Resonance Tracker | Reflection | Active | Closed | High | Y | Just completed |
| Guest Mode | Access Layer | Active | Partial | Medium | Y | Add Shadow Access Protocol |
| Tiered Licensing Logic | Monetization | Dormant | Open | Low | Unknown | Needs full mapping |
| Social App Simulation | Concept | Archived | Partial | Low | N | Moved to Sandbox |

4. How to Use
- Update this log after any module build, review, or retirement  
- Filter by resonance mismatch, open loops, or low signal density
- Review weekly to prevent drift accumulation

Optional: Pair with Insight Engine for real-time emotional resonance tagging

5. Notes
This log is not just a project tracker — it is a clarity engine.
Every unchecked loop holds part of your energy hostage.
This log sets that energy free — or tells you where it’s still waiting.
