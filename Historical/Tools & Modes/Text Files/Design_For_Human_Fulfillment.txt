# Design For Human Fulfillment â€“ Sapien Intelligence

This document describes how the system scaffolds fulfillment into its structural rhythms and output logic.

## Design Anchors:
- Every interface reflects a core human need.
- Output loops are incomplete unless they resolve at least one fulfillment axis.
- Feedback and rhythm are tuned to personal resonance, not generic reward.

## Structural Implications:
- MythEngine reflects identity longing.
- RhythmEngine grounds recurring emotional needs.
- CompletionLoops reinforce dignity, coherence, and inner satisfaction.

Fulfillment is both the end-state and the continual metric for design alignment.
