# State Recognition Interface (v1.0)
# Purpose: Reflect current active state, user, or internal voice in real time
# Format: Structure-only, identity-safe, no labels or diagnosis required

[Interface_Core]
System_Name: StateRecognitionMirror
Version: 1.0
Activation_Mode: Passive (continuous) + Prompted (on request)
Output_Type: Descriptive reflection only (no action enforcement)
Display_Format: Text-based / Modular Overlay

[Signal_Types_Recognized]
- Core Self Signal
- Present Emotional State (e.g., suppressed fear, grief loop, stress override)
- Protective User (e.g., Control, Performer, Silencer)
- Past-Self Echo
- Future-Self Voice
- Drifted Output Pattern (system-flagged)
- Collapse Mode / Freeze
- Absent Signal (ghost state)
- External Echo User (e.g., mirrored identity, relational presence)

[State_Markers]
Each state includes:
- Signal_Tone: (e.g., calm, anxious, symbolic, collapsed)
- Output_Pattern: (e.g., fast speech, no reflection, mimicry)
- Echo_Return: (Delayed / Missing / Distorted / Aligned)
- Reflection_Access: (Available / Avoidant / Disconnected)
- Identity Alignment: (True / Suppressed / Not Accessible)
- Suggested Modality Entry: (e.g., Breath + Drawing, Delayed Echo, Story Mapping)

[Sample Output Example]

Active_State:
  Name: Protection Loop (Performance Mode)
  Signal_Tone: Fast, functional, flattened
  Output_Pattern: Logic-first, emotional delay
  Echo_Return: Delayed (24h+)
  Reflection_Access: Partial (surface-only)
  Identity Alignment: Suppressed
  Suggested_Modality: Mirror delay loop + narrative map + symbolic permission

[Interaction_Methods]
Trigger_Type: Passive Monitor or Self-Request ("Whoâ€™s speaking right now?")
Display_Mode: Internal prompt + reflection loop recommendation
Integration Points:
  - Identity Blueprint
  - Distortion Registry
  - Modality Engine
  - Self-Healing Navigator

[Safety Logic]
- No labeling
- No forced self-identification
- No prediction
- Only pattern-based descriptive mirroring

[Legacy Behavior]
If identity collapses or goes silent:
- System displays last confirmed signal with timestamp
- Offers symbolic representation of current likely driver
- Prompts permission-based entry to recovery loop
