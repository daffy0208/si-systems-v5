Structural Ethics Framework â€“ Sapien Intelligence

1. All architecture must support wholeness.
2. No design may encourage fragmentation or disassociation.
3. System control must never override user clarity or consent.
4. Every function must include a reflection path and a restoration logic.

Design follows ethics, not the other way around.
