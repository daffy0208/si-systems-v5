## Prompt:
Can you write the latest and full up to date folder structure tree for si systems, brainframeos, sapien pro and all of the components and modes, with all components and nothing missing

2/2

## Response:
Thought for 5 seconds

I’d be happy to—but to ensure it’s truly “latest and full” I’ll need access to the actual repositories (or at least a filesystem snapshot) for:

*   **si‑systems**
*   **brainframeos**
*   **sapien‑pro**

Could you:

1.  **Share a link** to the GitHub (or other) repos, or
2.  **Upload a ZIP** of the directory roots, or
3.  Let me know if you’d rather I provide a small script you can run locally to emit the complete `tree` for each?

Once I have that, I can generate an exact, up‑to‑date folder‑structure tree with every component and mode included. Let me know which works best!
