# Drift Detection — Monitoring Alignment Over Time

## Purpose

The Drift Detection module continuously monitors interaction patterns over time to detect when either the **user** or the **AI** begins to drift away from the original communication style, purpose, or identity boundaries.

This is critical for:
- **Long sessions**
- **Ongoing human–AI partnerships**
- **Repetitive task environments**
- **Emotional or identity-sensitive applications**

## What Drift Looks Like

| Drift Type             | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Tone Drift**          | Gradual shift in output language — e.g., from confident to defensive |
| **Purpose Drift**       | AI responses no longer align with the user’s stated goals |
| **Cognitive Drift**     | Increasing abstraction, vagueness, or off-topic responses |
| **Rhythm Drift**        | Misalignment in pacing, verbosity, or stylistic consistency |
| **Identity Drift**      | Loss of user-specific phrasing or framing — AI starts to "reshape" the human's language |

---

## Detection Method

1. **Session Logging**  
   Tracks prompt/output sequences, timestamps, tone scores, and context anchors

2. **Pattern Matching**  
   Compares current responses against baseline interaction profile

3. **Threshold System**  
   Flags drift when deviations exceed preset boundaries (configurable per user or use case)

4. **Trigger Response**  
   When drift is detected:
   - Alert user or developer
   - Route through Prompting Engine for correction
   - Store snapshot for post-session analysis

---

## Example: Identity Drift

**Session Start**:  
User writes in calm, structured tone using formal language.

**After 40 minutes**:  
Model outputs start including slang, urgency, or sarcasm — not present in user’s profile.

**Drift Detected**:  
Mismatch in rhythm + tone. Response blocked and session marked for recalibration.

## Drift Severity Ratings

| Level     | System Action |
|-----------|---------------|
| Low       | Log only      |
| Medium    | Feedback to Prompting Engine for tone correction |
| High      | Output blocked, context reset required |
| Critical  | Full session reset or human review |

---

## Integration Points

- **Scan Engine**: Supplies live comparison metrics  
- **Prompting Engine**: Rewrites prompts if drift begins to affect output quality  
- **Output Filter**: Final layer that confirms whether drift has been contained

## Developer Notes

- Drift thresholds should be set per domain: e.g., higher sensitivity for leadership coaching, lower for creative writing  
- Drift logs can be anonymized and used for session training or review  
- Longitudinal drift detection (across days/weeks) is planned for future versions
