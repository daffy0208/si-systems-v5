# Output Filter — Signal Integrity and Trust Enforcement

## Purpose

The Output Filter is the final checkpoint before an AI model’s response is shown to the user.  
Its job is to **protect the user from drift, distortion, emotional erosion, or tonal mismatch** — without compromising the usefulness or intelligence of the AI output.

This is **not censorship** — it’s a **coherence layer** to preserve clarity, tone, rhythm, and user-defined alignment.

## What It Filters

| Checkpoint            | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Tone Deviation**      | Detects if the output tone misaligns with the user’s preferred range |
| **Emotional Sharpness** | Flags responses that are manipulative, dismissive, or emotionally unsafe |
| **Purpose Drift**       | Identifies content that veers from the user’s original intent or session goals |
| **Over-simplification** | Blocks responses that flatten complexity or over-generalize sensitive input |
| **Language Contamination** | Prevents adoption of phrasing patterns that weren’t part of user tone |

## Workflow

1. **Intercepts AI Output**  
   Captures the raw text before display

2. **Runs Multi-Layer Evaluation**  
   Uses structured checks (drift, tone, rhythm, symbolic flattening, etc.)

3. **Triggers Actions**  
   - Approve
   - Modify
   - Block + Rewrite
   - Route back to Prompting Engine for adjustment

4. **Returns Final Response**  
   Only if the output passes integrity validation or is modified to do so

## Examples

### Example 1: Tone Misalignment

**Output**:  
> “That’s actually not how it works, and you’re misunderstanding the process.”

**Result**:  
Blocked for tone breach (condescending). Rewritten to:  
> “There may be a misunderstanding here. Let me clarify how the process typically works.”

---

### Example 2: Emotional Drift

**Output**:  
> “You should have done this differently. Here’s what you missed.”

**Result**:  
Blocked for passive-aggressive phrasing. Adjusted for neutrality.

## Technical Features

- **Score-Based Gatekeeping**  
  Outputs are evaluated against a scoring rubric (tone, clarity, purpose alignment)

- **Failover Logic**  
  In case of blocked output, can:
  - Return modified response
  - Request new generation
  - Escalate to human-in-the-loop

- **Customizable Filter Profiles**  
  Can be tuned per user, role, or domain (e.g., leadership, therapy, technical writing)

## Output Filter vs. Standard Moderation

| Feature             | Output Filter           | Traditional Moderation |
|---------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Focus               | Alignment + Integrity   | Safety + Compliance     |
| Granularity         | Sentence / Phrase level | Whole-message threshold |
| Dynamic Feedback    | Yes                     | No                      |
| Emotional Precision | Required                | Optional                |
